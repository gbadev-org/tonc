  About this page</h2>
<p>
As you probably know, the GBA is capable of applying geometric 
transformations like rotating and/or scaling to sprites and
backgrounds. To set them apart from the regular items, the 
transformable ones are generally referred to as Rot/Scale sprites 
and backgrounds. The transformations are described by four parameters, 
<code>pa</code>, <code>pb</code>, <code>pc</code> and <code>pd</code>. 
The locations and exact names differ for sprites and backgrounds but 
that doesn't matter for now.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways of interpreting these numbers. The first is to 
think of each of them as individual offsets to the sprite and
background data. This is how the reference documents like
<a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">GBATek</a> and 
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~tjh8300/CowBite/CowBiteSpec.htm" target="_blank">
CowBite Spec</a> describe them. The other way is to see them as the
elements of a 2x2 matrix which I will refer to as <b>P</b>. This is 
how pretty much all tutorials describe them. These tutorials also 
give the following matrix for rotation and scaling:
</p>

<table id="eq-prs-bad">

  <tr>
    <td><i>p</i><sub>c</sub>
    <td>&nbsp;
    <td><i>p</i><sub>d</sub>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  <td class="eqcell"> &nbsp;=&nbsp;
  <td class="eqcell">
  <table class="eqtbl" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>

  <tr>
    <td class="bdrLL" rowspan=2>&nbsp;
    <td><i>s</i><sub>x</sub>&middot;cos(&alpha;)
    <td>&nbsp;
    <td><i>s</i><sub>y</sub>&middot;sin(&alpha;)
    <td class="bdrRR" rowspan=2>&nbsp;
  <tr>
    <td>&minus;<i>s</i><sub>x</sub>&middot;sin(&alpha;)
    <td>&nbsp;
    <td><i>s</i><sub>y</sub>&middot;cos(&alpha;)
  </tbody>
  </table>
</table>

<p>
Now, this is indeed a rotation and scale matrix. Unfortunately, it's
also the <span class="rem">wrong one</span>! Or at least, it probably 
does not do what you'd expect. For example, consider the 
case with a scaling of <i>s</i><sub>x</sub>= 1.5, <i>s</i><sub>y</sub>= 1.0
and a rotation of &alpha;= 45. You'd probably expect something like
fig&nbsp;10.1a, but what you'd actually get is
10.1b. The sprite has rotated, but in the 
wrong direction, it has shrunk rather than expanded and there's an 
extra shear as well. Of course, you can always say that you meant
for this to happen, but that's probably not quite true.

Unfortunately, there is a lot of incorrect or misleading information on 
the transformation matrix around; the matrix of 
eq&nbsp;10.1 is just one aspect of it. This actually 
starts with the moniker &ldquo;Rot/Scale&rdquo;, which does not fit 
with what actually occurs, continues with the fact that the terms
used are never properly defined and that most people often 
just copy-paste from others without even considering checking whether
the information is correct or not. The irony is that the principle 
reference document, GBATek, gives the correct descriptions of each 
of the elements, but somehow it got lost in the translation to matrix 
form in the tutorials.
</p>
<p>
In this chapter, I'll provide the <b>correct</b> interpretation
of the <b>P</b>-matrix; how the GBA uses it and how to construct one
yourself. To do this, though, I'm going into full math-mode. If you
don't know your way around vector and matrix calculations you may have
some difficulties understanding the finer points of the text. 
There is an appendix on <a href="matrix.htm">linear algebra</a> for
some pointers on this subject.
</p><br>
<p>
This is going to be a purely theoretical page: you will find
nothing that relates directly to sprites or backgrounds here; that's
what the next two sections are for. Once again, we will be assisted 
by the lovely metroid (keep in cold storage for safe use). Please
mind the direction of the y-axis and the angles, and do <i>not</i>
leave without reading the <a href="#sec-finish">finishing up</a>
paragraph. This contains several key implementation details that 
will be ignored in the text preceding it, because they will only get
in the way at that point.
</p>

<div class="note">
<div class="nhcare">Be wary of documents covering affine parameters</div>
<p>
It's true. Pretty much every document I've seen that deals with 
this subject is problematic in some way. A lot of them give the wrong 
rotate-scale matrix (namely, the one in 
eq&nbsp;10.1), or misname and/or misrepresent the 
matrix and its elements.

  General 2D texture mapping</h3>
<p>
What the GBA does to get sprites and tiled backgrounds on screen is
very much like texture mapping. So forget about the GBA right now and 
look at how texture mapping is done. In 
fig&nbsp;10.2a, we see a metroid 
texture. For convenience I am using the standard Cartesian 2D 
coordinate system (y-axis points up) and have normalised the 
texture, which means that the right and top side of the texture 
correspond precisely with the unit-vectors <b>e</b><sub>x</sub> and 
<b>e</b><sub>y</sub> (which are of length 1).  The texture mapping 
brings <b>p</b> (in texture space) to a point <b>q</b> (in screen 
space). The actual mapping is done by a 2&times;2 matrix <b>A</b>:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <td class="fill">
  <td class="eqcell">
    <b>q</b>= <b>A &middot; p</b>.
</table>

<p>
So how do you find <b>A</b>? Well, that's actually not that hard.
The matrix is formed by lining up the transformed base vectors, 
which are <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> (this works in any number of 
dimensions, btw), so that gives us:
</p>

  Affine transformations</h3>
<p>
The transformations you can do with a 2D matrix are called 
<dfn><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine" target="_blank">affine</a></dfn> 
transformations. The technical definition of an 
affine transformation is one that preserves parallel lines, which 
basically means that you can write them as matrix transformations, or 
that a rectangle will become a parallelogram under an affine 
transformation (see fig&nbsp;10.2b).
</p>
<p>
Affine
transformations include rotation and scaling, but <i>also</i> shearing.
This is why I object to the name &ldquo;Rot/Scale&rdquo;: that
term only refers to a special case, not the general transformation. It
is akin to calling colors shades of red: yes, reds are colors too,
but not all colors are reds, and to call them that would give a 
distorted view of the subject.
</p>
<p>
As I said, there are three basic 2d transformations, though you can
always describe one of these in terms of the other two. The 
transformations are: rotation (<b>R</b>), scaling (<b>S</b>) 
and shear (<b>H</b>). Table 10.1 shows what 
each of the transformations does to the regular metroid sprite. The 
black axes are the normal base vectors (note that <i>y</i> points 
down!), the blue axes are the transformed base vectors and the cyan 
variables are the arguments of the transformation. Also given are the 
matrix and inverse matrix of each transformation. Why? You'll see.

<div class="note">
<div class="nh">Clockwise vs counterclockwise</div>
<p>
It's a minor issue, but I have to mention it. If the definition 
of <b>R</b> uses a clockwise rotation, why am I suddenly using a 
counter-clockwise one? Well, traditionally <b>R</b> is given as that
particular matrix, in which the angle runs from the x-axis towards 
the y-axis. Because <i>y</i> is downward, this comes down to 
clockwise. However, the affine routines in BIOS use a 
counter-clockwise rotation, and I thought it'd be a good idea to use 
that as a guideline for my functions.
</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<div class="nh">Nomenclature: Affine vs Rot/Scale</div>
<p>
The matrix <b>P</b> is not a rotation matrix, not a scaling matrix, 
but a general affine transformation matrix. Rotation and scaling may 
be what the matrix is mostly used for, but that does not mean they're
the only things possible, as the term &lsquo;Rot/Scale&rsquo;
would imply.
</p>
<p>
To set them apart from regular backgrounds and sprites, I suppose 
&lsquo;Rotation&rsquo; or &lsquo;Rot/Scale&rsquo; are suitable 
enough, just not entirely accurate. However, calling the 
<b>P</b>-matrix by those names is simply wrong.

As you must have noticed, eq&nbsp;10.3 is

something different than what

in the first place (namely a scaling by <i>s</i><sub>x</sub> and

&alpha;). The <i>real</i> question is of course, why doesn't this 
work? To answer this I will present two different approaches to the

<h3 id="ssec-pov-human">10.3.1.
  Human point of view</h3>
<p>
&ldquo;Hello, I am Cearn's brain. I grok geometry and can do matrix-
transformations in my head. Well, his head actually. When it comes to
texture mapping I see the original map (in texture space) and then 
visualize the transformation. I look at the original map and look at 
where the map's pixels end up on screen. The transformation matrix for 
this is <b>A</b>, which ties texel <b>p</b> to screen pixel <b>q</b> 
via <b>q</b>= <b>A · p</b>. The columns of <b>A</b> are simply the
transformed unit matrices. Easy as &pi;.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Hello, I am Cearn's GBA. I'm a lean, mean gaming machine that fits in
your pocket, and I can push pixels like no one else. Except perhaps my 
owner's GeForce 4 Ti4200, the bloody show-off. Anyway, one of the things 
I do is texture mapping. And not just ordinary texture-mapping, I can 
do cool stuff like rotation and scaling as well. What I do is fill
pixels, all I need to know is for you to tell me where I should get 
the pixel's color from. In other words, to fill screen pixel <b>q</b>, 
I need a matrix <b>B</b> that gives me the proper texel <b>p</b> via
<b>p = B · q</b>. I'll happily use any matrix you give me; I have 
complete confidence in your ability to supply me with the matrix for 
the transformation you require.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-pov-res">10.3.3.
  Resolution</h3>
<p>
I hope you spotted the crucial difference between the two points of 
view. <b>A</b> maps <i>from</i> texture space <i>to</i> screen space, 
while <b>B</b> does the exact opposite (i.e., 
<b>B = A</b><sup>-1</sup>). I think you know which one you should give 
the GBA by now. That's right: <b>P = B</b>, not <b>A</b>. This one bit 
of information is the crucial piece of the affine matrix puzzle.
</p>
<p>
So now you can figure out <b>P</b>'s elements in two ways. You can stick
to the human POV and invert the matrix at the end. That's why I gave 
you the inverses of the affine transformations as well. You could also
try to see things in the GBA's way and get the right matrix directly.
Tonc's main affine functions (<tt>tonc_video.h</tt>, 
<tt>tonc_obj_affine.c</tt> and <tt>tonc_bg_affine.c</tt>) do things 
the GBA way, setting <b>P</b> directly; but inverted functions are also 
available using an &quot;<code>_inv</code>&quot; affix. 
Mind you, these are a little slower. Except for when scaling is 
involved; then it's a <i>lot</i> slower.
</p>
<p>
In case you're curious, the proper matrix for scale by
(<i>s</i><sub>x</sub>, <i>s</i><sub>x</sub>) and 
counter-clockwise rotation by &alpha; is:

  Finishing up</h2>
<p>
Knowing what the <b>P</b>-matrix is used for is one thing, knowing 
how to use them properly is another. There are three additional points 
you need to remember when you're going to deal with affine 
objects/backgrounds and the affine matrices.

  Data types of affine elements</h3>
<p>
Affine transformations are part of mathematics and, generally speaking, 
math numbers will be real numbers. That is to say, floating point 
numbers. However, if you were to use floating points for the 
<b>P</b> elements, you'd be in for two rude surprises.
</p>
<p>
The first one is that the matrix elements are not floats, but 
integers. The reason behind this is that <span class="ack">the GBA 
has no floating point unit!</span> All floating-point operations 
have to be done in software and without an FPU, that's going to 
be pretty slow. Much slower than integer math, at any rate. Now, 
when you think about this, it does create some problems with 
precision and all that. For example, the (co)sine and functions have 
a range between &minus;1 and 1, a range which isn't exactly large 
when it comes to integers. However, the range would be much greater 
if one didn't count in units of 1, but in fractions, say in units of 
1/256. The [&minus;1, +1] range then becomes [&minus;256, +256],
</p>
<p>
This strategy of representing real numbers with scaled integers 
is known as <dfn>fixed point arithmetic</dfn>, which you can read 
more about in <a href="fixed.htm">this appendix</a> and on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>. 
The GBA makes use of fixed point for its affine parameters, but you 
can use it for other things as well. The <b>P</b>-matrix elements 
are 8.8 fixed point numbers, meaning a halfword with 8 integer bits 
and 8 fractional bits. To set a matrix to identity (1s on the 
diagonals, 0s elsewhere), you wouldn't use this:
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
    <span class="cmt">// Floating point == Bad!!</span>
    pa= pd= <span class="num">1.0</span>;
    pb= pc= <span class="num">0.0</span>;
</pre>

<p>
but this:
</p>

<pre class= proglist>
    <span class="cmt">// .8 Fixed-point == Good</span>
    pa= pd= <span class="num">1</span>&lt;&lt;<span class="num">8</span>;
    pb= pc= <span class="num">0</span>;
</pre>

<p>
In a fixed point system with <i>Q</i> fractional bits, &lsquo;1&rsquo; 
(&lsquo;one&rsquo;) is represented by 2<sup>Q</sup> or 
1&lt;&lt;<i>Q</i>, because simply that's how fractions work.
</p>
<p>
Now, fixed point numbers are still just integers, but there are 
different types of integers, and it is important to use the right 
ones. 8.8f are 16bit variables, so the logical choice there is 
<code>short</code>. However, this should be a <i>signed</i> short: 
<code>s16</code>, not <code>u16</code>. Sometimes is doesn't matter, 
but if you want to do any arithmetic with them they'd better be 
signed. Remember that internally the CPU works in words, which are 
32bit, and the 16bit variable will be converted to that. 
You really want, say, a 16bit &quot;&minus;1&quot;
(<code>0xFFFF</code>) to turn into a 32bit 
&quot;&minus;1&quot; (<code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>), and not 
&quot;65535&quot; (<code>0x0000FFFF</code>), which is
what happens if you use unsigned shorts. Also, when doing fixed point 
math, it is recommended to use signed ints (the 32bit kind) for 
them, anything else will slow you down and you might get overflow 
problems as well.
</p><br>

<div class="note">
<div class="nhgood">Use 32-bit signed ints for affine temporaries</div>
<p>
Of course you should use 32bit variables for everything anyway (unless 
you actually <i>want</i> your code to bloat and slow down). If you use 
16bit variables (<code>short</code> or <code>s16</code>), not only will your 
code be slower because of all the extra instructions that are added to 
keep the variables 16bit, but overflow problems can occur much sooner. 
</p>
<p>
Only in the final step to hardware should you go to 8.8 format. Before 
that, use the larger types for both speed and accuracy.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ssec-fin-lut">10.4.2.
  LUTs</h3>
<p>
So fixed point math is used because floating point math is just to 
slow for efficient use. That's all fine and good for your own 
math, but what about mathematical functions like sin() and cos()? 
Those are still floating point internally (even worse, 
<i><code>double</code>s</i>!), so those are going to be ridiculously 
slow. 
</p>
<p>
Rather than using the 
functions directly, we'll use a time-honored tradition to weasel our 
way out of using costly math functions: we're going to build a 
<dfn>look-up table</dfn> (LUT) containing the sine and cosine values. 
There are a number of ways to do this. If you want an easy 
strategy, you can just declare two arrays of 360 8.8f numbers and 
fill them at initialization of your program. However, this is a 
poor way of doing things, for reasons explained in the 
<a href="fixed.htm#sec-lut">section on LUTs</a> in the appendix.
</p>
<p>
Tonclib has a single sine lut which can be used for both sine and 
cosine values. The lut is called <code>sin_lut</code>, a 
<code>const short</code> array of 512 4.12f entries 
(12 fractional bits), created by my 
<a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/#excellut" target="_blank">excellut</a> 
lut creator. In <tt>tonc_math.h</tt> you can find two inline 
functions that retrieve sine and cosine values:
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="cmt">//! Look-up a sine and cosine values
/*! \param theta Angle in [0,FFFFh] range
*   \return .12f sine value
*/</span>

INLINE s32 lu_sin(uint theta)
{   <span class="keyw">return</span> sin_lut[(theta&gt;&gt;<span 
class="num">7</span>)&amp;<span class="num">0x1FF</span>];           }

INLINE s32 lu_cos(uint theta)
{   <span class="keyw">return</span> sin_lut[((theta&gt;&gt;<span 
class="num">7</span>)+<span class="num">128</span>)&amp;<span 
class="num">0x1FF</span>];     }
</pre>
<p>
Now, note the angle range: 0-10000h. Remember you don't <i>have</i> 
to use 360 degrees for a circle; in fact, on computers it's better to 
divide the circle in a power of two instead. In this case, the angle 
is in 2<sup>16</sup> parts for compatibility with BIOS functions, 
which is brought down to a 512 range inside the look-up functions.
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-fin-init">10.4.3.
  Initialization</h3>
<p>
When flagging a background or object as affine, you <i>must</i> 
enter at least some values into <code>pa-pd</code>. Remember 
that these are zeroed out by default. A zero-offset means it'll use the 
first pixel for the whole thing. If you get a single-colored
background or sprite, this is probably why. To avoid this, set <b>P</b>
to the identity matrix or any other non-zero matrix.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-aff-fun">10.5.
  Tonc's affine functions</h2>
<p>
Tonclib contains a number of functions for manipulating the affine 
parameters of objects and backgrounds, as used by the 
<code>OBJ_AFFINE</code> and <code>BG_AFFINE</code> structs. Because 
the affine matrix is stored differently in both structs you can't 
set them with the same function, but the functionality is the same. 
In table 10.2 you can find the basic formats 
and descriptions; just replace <i>foo</i> with 
<code>obj_aff</code> or <code>bg_aff</code> and <i>FOO</i> with 
<code>OBJ</code> or <code>BG</code> for objects and backgrounds, 
respectively. The functions themselves can be found in 
<tt>tonc_obj_affine.c</tt> for objects, <tT>tonc_bg_affine.c</tt> for 
backgrounds, and inlines for both in <tt>tonc_video.h</tt> &hellip; 
somewhere.

  Sample rot/scale function</h3>
<p>
My code for a object version of the scale-then-rotate 
function (&agrave; la eq&nbsp;10.4) is 
given below. Note that it is from the computer's point of view, so 
that <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code> scale down. Also, the 
alpha <code>alpha</code> uses 10000h/circle (i.e., the unit of 
&alpha; is &pi;/8000h = 0.096 mrad, or 180/8000h = 0.0055&deg;) 
and the sine lut is 
in .12f format, which is why the shifts by 12 are required. The 
background version is identical, except in name and type. If this 
were C++, templates would have been mighty useful here.

<p>
With the information in this chapter, you know most of what you need 
to know about affine matrices, starting with why they should be 
referred to <i>affine</i> matrices, rather than merely rotation or 
rot/scale or the other names you might see elsewhere. You should now 
know what the thing actually does, and how you can set up a matrix 
for the effects you want. You should also know a little bit about 
fixed point numbers and luts (for more, look in the 
<a href="fixed.htm">appendices</a>) and why they're Good Things; if 
it hadn't been clear before, you should be aware that the choice  
of the data types you use actually <i>matters</i>, and you should 
not just use the first thing that comes along. 
</p>
<p>
What has not been discussed here is how you actually set-up objects 
and backgrounds to use affine transformation, which is what the next 
two chapters are for. For more on affine transformations, try 
searching for &lsquo;linear algebra&rsquo;
