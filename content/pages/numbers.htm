  The true meaning of symbols</h3>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;There are 10 kinds of people in the world, those that
understand binary and those that don't.&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>
If you don't get the joke, you belong in the latter category. Just
like everyone else, in your youth you've probably learned that the 
combination of numerals &lsquo;1&rsquo; and &lsquo;0&rsquo; means ten.
Not so &ndash; not exactly. The primary problem here is the meaning of
symbols. Now, what I'm about to tell you
is key to understanding mystifying stuff out there, so gather around 
and let me tell you something about what they really mean. Listening? 
Alright then. Your basic everyday symbol, like &lsquo;1&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;0&rsquo; and such,
your basic symbol means exactly <b>SQUAT</b>!
</p>
<p>
That's right: zilch, zip, nada, noppes, dick, and all the other
synonyms you can think of that mean &lsquo;nothing&rsquo;. In and of 
themselves, symbols have no meaning; rather, meaning <i>is imposed</i> 
on them by us humans. Symbols are means of communication. There's a 
lot of stuff in the world &ndash;objects, people, feelings, 
actions&ndash; and we label these things with symbols to tell them 
apart. The symbols themselves mean nothing; they're just 
<dfn>representations</dfn>, labels that we can make up as we see fit. 
Unfortunately, this is something that is rarely mentioned when you're 
growing up, the only thing they tell you is which symbol is tied to 
which concept, which can lead people to confuse the thing itself with 
its representation. There are people that do just this, but still 
realise that the symbols are just social constructs, and start 
believing that the things they represent, stuff like gravity and the 
number &pi;, are just social constructs too. (Yet these same people 
aren't willing to demonstrate this by, say, stepping out of a window 
on the 22th floor.)
</p>
<p>
As a simple example of symbol(s), consider the word &ldquo;chair&rdquo;.
The word itself has no intrinsic relationship with a &ldquo;piece of 
furniture for one person to sit on, having a back and, usually, four
legs.&rdquo; (Webster's); it's just handy to have a word for such an
object so that we know what we're talking about in a conversation.
Obviously, this only works if all parties in the
conversation use the same words for the same objects, so at some point
in the past a couple of guys got together and decided on a set of
words and called it the English language. Since words are just
symbols with no intrinsic meaning, different groups can and have come
up with a different set of words.
</p>
<p>
Such an agreement between people for the sake of convenience is called 
a <dfn>convention</dfn> (basically, a fancy word for standard). 
Conventions can be found everywhere. That's part of the problem: they 
are so ubiquitous that they're usually taken for granted. At some point 
in time, a convention has become so normal that people forget that it 
was merely an agreement made to facilitate communication, and will 
attach real meaning to the thing convened upon: the convention is now a
&ldquo;tradition&rdquo;.
<!-- Then at some point people will believe so strongly in it that they
will kill for it, and it becomes a &ldquo;religion&rdquo;.-->
</p>
<p>
Back to numbers. Numbers are used for two things: quantities and 
identifications (cardinal and ordinal numbers, respectively). It's 
primarily quantities we're concerned with here: one banana, two bananas,
three bananas, that sort of thing. The way numbers are written down 
&ndash;represented by symbols&ndash; is merely a convention; for
most people, it's probably even a tradition. There are a couple of 
different ways to represent numbers: 
by words (one, two, three, four, five)
by carvings (<i>I, II, III, IIII, <s>IIII</s></i>),
Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V). 
You have all seen these at some point or another. The system most 
commonly used, however, is a variant of what's called the
<dfn>base-<i>N</i> positional system</dfn>.
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-num-basen">A.1.2.
  The Base-<i>N</i> Positional System</h3>
<p>
&ldquo;So, Mike, what is the base-n positional system?&rdquo;. Well,
it's probably the most convenient system to use when you have to write
down long numbers and/or do arithmetic! The basic idea is that you
have <i>N</i> symbols &ndash;numerals&ndash; at your disposal,
for 0 up to <i>N</i>&minus;1, and you represent each possible number 
by a <i>string</i> of <i>m</i> numerals. The numeral at position 
<i>i</i> in the string, <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>, is a multiplier of the 
<i>i</i>-th power of the base number. The complete number <i>S</i> is 
the sum of the product of the powers <i>N</i><sup>i</sup> and their
multipliers <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>.
</p>

<table id="eq-num-sum">
<tr>
  <td class="eqnrcell">(A.1)
  <td class="eqcell">
    <i>S</i> = <big>&Sigma;</big> 
	  <i>a</i><sub>i</sub>&middot;<i>N</i> <sup>i</sup>
</table>

<p>
Another way of thinking about the system is by looking at these
numbers as a set of counters, like old-style odometers in
cars and old cassette players. Here you have a number of revolving
wheels with <i>N</i> numerals on each. Each wheel is set so that 
they will increment the counter before it after a revolution has 
been completed. You start with all zeros, and then begin to turn the 
last wheel. After <i>N</i> numbers have passed, you will have a full 
revolution: this counter will be back to zero, and the one next to it 
will increase by one. And again after <i>N</i> more counts, and after 
<i>N</i><sup>2</sup> the second counter will be full as well and so 
a third counter will increase, etc, etc.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Here's an example using the familiar case of
<i>N</i> is ten: the decimal system. Base-ten means ten different
symbols (digits): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Note that the form of
these symbols is arbitrary, but this is how we got/stole them from the
Arabs centuries ago. Note also the zero symbol. The zero is one of
the key discoveries in mathematics, and makes the positional system
possible. Now, for our sample string of numerals, consider
&ldquo;1025&rdquo;, which is to be read as:
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table>
<tr><td>1025<sub>ten</sub>
  <td>=<td> 1·10<sup>3</sup><sub>ten</sub>
  <td>+<td> 0·10<sup>2</sup><sub>ten</sub>
  <td>+<td> 2·10<sup>1</sup><sub>ten</sub>
  <td>+<td> 5·10<sup>0</sup><sub>ten</sub>
<tr><td>
  <td>=<td> 1·1000<sub>ten</sub>
  <td>+<td> 0·100<sub>ten</sub>
  <td>+<td> 2·10<sub>ten</sub>
  <td>+<td>5·1
<tr><td><td>=<td colspan=7> one thousand twenty five
</table>
</div>

<!--
<p>
Using the counters point of view, it would mean that the first counter
has gone round 102<sub>ten</sub> times, the second counter
(for 10<sup>1</sup>) 10<sub>ten</sub> times
</p>
-->

<p>
You may have noticed I'm using words for numbers a lot of the time.
The thing is that if you write the &lsquo;<i>N</i>&rsquo; in
&lsquo;base-<i>N</i>&rsquo; in its own base, you will always write
&lsquo;base-10&rsquo;, because the string &ldquo;10&rdquo; 
<i>always</i> denoted the base number. That's kind of the point. To 
point out which &ldquo;10&rdquo; you're talking about, I've followed 
the usual convention and subscripted it with the word 
&ldquo;ten&rdquo;. But because it's a big hassle to subscript every 
number, I'll use another convention that if the number isn't 
subscripted, it's a base-ten number. Yes, like everyone has been 
doing all along, only I've taken the effort of explicitly mentioning 
the convention.
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-num-bin">A.1.3.
  base-2: binary</h3>
<p>
What you have to remember is that there's nothing special
about using 10 (that is, ten) as the base number; it could have just
as well been 2 (binary), 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal). True story: in
the later decades of the 18th century, when the French were developing
the metric system to standardize, well, everything, there
were also proposals for going to a duodecimal (base-12) system, because
of its many factors. The only reason base-ten is popular is because
humans have ten fingers, and that's all there is to it.
</p>
<p>
As an example, let's look at the binary (base-2) system. This
system is kinda special in that it is the simplest base-<i>N</i> system,
using only two numbers 0 and 1. It is also perfect for clear-cut
choices: on/off, black/white, high/low. This makes it ideal for
computer-systems and since we're programmers here, you'd better know
something about binary.
</p>
<p>
As said, you only have two symbols (BInary digiTs, or bits) here: 
0 and 1. In the decimal system, you have ten symbols before you have
to add a new numeral to the string: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
But in a binary system you'll already need a second numeral for two:
0, 1, 10 (with two represented by &lsquo;10&rsquo;). This means that 
you get large strings fairly quickly. For example, let's look the 
number 1025 again. To write this down in binary we have to find the
multipliers for the powers of two that will add up to 1025. First,
of course, we need the powers of two themselves. The first 11 are:
</p>

<tr><td>10 <td>100,0000,0000<td>1024
</table>
</div>

<p>
As you can see, the length of binary numbers rises really quickly.
With longer numbers it's often difficult to see the actual size of the
critter, so I comma-separated them into numeral groups of 4. 
If you're serious about programming, you
<i>need</i> to know the powers of two, preferably up to 16.
The nice thing about binary is that you won't have to worry much about
the multiplication factors of the powers, as the only possibilities are
0 and 1. This makes decimal&harr;binary conversions relatively easy. 
For 1025, it is:

<!--
Fortunately, their decimal representation will suffice. With those
in hand, it's fairly easy to see the binary representation of 1025:
-->
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table>
<tr><td>1025<sub>ten</sub>
  <td>=<td> 1024 <td>+<td> 1
<tr><td>
  <td>=<td> 2<sup>10</sup> <td>+<td> 2<sup>0</sup>
<tr><td>
  <td>=<td colspan=4>100,0000,0001<sub>bin</sub>
</table>
</div>

<p>
An interesting and completely fortuitous factoid about binary is that
2<sup>10</sup>=1024 is almost 10<sup>3</sup>=1000. Because of this, you 
will often find powers of 1024 indicated by metric prefixes: kilo-,
mega-, giga- etc. The correspondence isn't perfect, of course, but it 
is a good approximate. It also gives salesmen a good swindling angle: 
since in the computer world powers of 2 reign supreme, one Megabyte 
(MB) is 1.05 bytes, but with some justification you could also use
the traditional 1M = one million in memory sizes, and thus make it
<i>seem</i> that your product has 5% more memory. You will also see 
both notations used randomly in Windows programs, and it's almost 
impossible to see whether or not that file that Explorer says is 1.4MB 
will fit on your floppy disk or not.

In itself, binary isn't so difficult, it's just that the numbers are
so large! The solution for this given above was using commas to
divide them into groups of four. There is a better solution, namely
hexadecimal.
</p>
<p>
Hexadecimal is the name for the base-16 system, also known as
<dfn>hex</dfn>. That an abbreviation exists should tell you something
about its prevalence. As you should be able to guess by now, there
are 16 symbols in hex. This presents a small problem because we only
have 10 symbols associated with numbers. Rather than invent new
symbols, the first letters of the alphabet are used, so the sequence
becomes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f. Hex is
more concise than binary. In fact, since 16 is 2<sup>4</sup>, you can
exactly fit four bits into one hex digit, so hex is
exactly 4 times as short as binary. This is also why I used groups of
four earlier on. If you know the powers of 2, then you automatically 
know the powers of 16 too, but rather than decompose numbers into 
powers of 16, it's often easier to go to binary first, make groups
and convert those to hex.
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table>
<tr><td>1025<sub>ten</sub>
  <td>=<td colspan=4>100,0000,0001<sub>bin</sub>
<tr><td>
  <td>=<td>401<sub>bin</sub>·16<sup>2</sup> <td>+<td>1·16<sup>0</sup>
<tr><td>
  <td>=<td colspan=4>401<sub>hex</sub>
</table>
</div>

<p>
A hexadecimal digit is often called a <dfn>nybble</dfn> or a nibble,
which fits in nicely with the bit and the byte. Speaking of bytes, 
bytes are conventionally made up of 8 bits, and hence 2 nybbles. So 
you can conveniently write down bytes and multiple byte types in 
nybbles. My personal preference in dealing with hex numbers in to 
always use an even number of nybbles, to correspond with the whole
bytes, but that's just me. Hexadecimal is so engrained in the computer 
world that it not only has an abbreviation, but also a number of 
shorthand notations indicating numbers are
indeed hex: C uses the prefix &lsquo;0x&rsquo;, in assembly you might 
find &lsquo;$&rsquo;, and in normal text the affix &lsquo;h&rsquo; is 
sometimes used.
</p><br>

<p>
Depending on how low-level you do your programming, you will see any
of the three systems mentioned above. Aside from decimal, binary and
hexadecimal, you might also encounter octal (C prefix &lsquo;0&rsquo;) 
from time to time. Now, even if you know never intend to use octal, you 
might use it accidentally. If you would like to align your columns of 
numbers by padding them with zeros, you are actually converting them 
to octal! Yet one more of those fiendish little bugs that will have 
you tearing your hair out.
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-num-base-use">A.1.5.
  Using the positional system</h3>

<p>
Using a base-<i>N</i> positional system has a number of advantages over
the other number systems. For starters, numbers don't get nearly as
long as the carving system; and you don't have to invent new symbols
for higher numbers, like in the Roman system. It's also easier to
compare two numbers using either the lengths of the strings or just
the first number. There's also a tie with probability theory: each
individual digit has <i>N</i> possibilities, so a number-string with
length <i>m</i> has <i>N<sup>m</sup></i> possibilities.
</p>
<p>
Where it really comes into its own is arithmetic. The
positions in a number-string are equivalent, so the steps for adding
&lsquo;3+4&rsquo; are the same for &lsquo;30+40&rsquo;. This will 
allow you to break up large calculations into smaller, easier ones. If 
you can do calculations for single-symbol numbers, you can do them all. 
What's more, the steps themselves are the same, regardless of which 
base you use. I won't show you how to do addition in binary or hex, as 
that's rather trivial, but I will demonstrate multiplication. Here's an
example of calculating &lsquo;123 &times; 456&rsquo;, in decimal and 
hexadecimal. I've also given the multiplication tables for convenience.

<p>
In both cases, I followed exactly the same procedure: break up the big
numbers into powers of <i>N</i>, lookup the individual multiplications
in the tables and stick the right number of zeros behind them, and then
add them all up. You can check with a calculator to see that these
numbers are correct. Hexadecimal arithmetic isn't any harder than
decimal; it just <i>seems</i> harder because they haven't drilled it
into your brain at a young age.
</p>
<p>
I should point out that 4EDC2<sub>hex</sub> is actually
323010<sub>dec</sub>, and not 56088<sub>dec</sub>.
And it shouldn't be, because the second multiplication was
<i>all</i> in hex:
123<sub>hex</sub>&times; 456<sub>hex</sub>, which actually corresponds 
to 291<sub>dec</sub>&times; 1110<sub>dec</sub>. This is why implicit
conventions can cause trouble: in different conventions, the <i>same</i>
number-string can mean completely <i>different</i> things. Please keep
that in mind.
(Incidentally, facts like this also disprove that mental virus known 
as numerology. (Of course, it doesn't in the eyes of its adherents,
because that's one of the characteristics of belief systems: belief 
actually grows as evidence mounts against them, instead of 
diminishing it.))
</p>


<h4 id="num-float">Look, it floats!</h4>
<!-- throw it into the pond! -->

<p>
Something that is only possible in a positional system is the use of a
floating point. Each numeral in a number-string represents a multiplier
for a power of <i>N</i>, but why use only positive powers? Negative 
powers of <i>x</i> are successive multiplications of 1/<i>x</i>: 
<i>x</i><sup>&minus;n</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(1/<i>x</i>)<sup>n</sup>. For 
example, &pi; can be broken down like this:
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<col span=9 width=32>
<tr align="center">
  <th>exp
  <td> 3 <td> 2 <td> 1 <th> 0 <td> -1 <td> -2 <td> -3 <td> -4 <td>...
<tr align="center">
  <th>pow
  <td> 1000 <td> 100 <td> 10 <th> 1
  <td> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>   <td> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>
  <td> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> <td> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10000</sub>
  <td> ...
<tr align="center">
  <th>&pi;
  <td> 0 <td> 0 <td> 0 <th> 3 <td> 1 <td> 4 <td> 1 <td> 6 <td> ...
</table>
</div>

<p>
You can't simply use a number-string for this; you need to know where 
the negative powers start. This is done with a period: 
&pi;&asymp;3.1416. At least, the English community uses the
period; over here in the Netherlands, people use a comma. That's yet
another one of those convention mismatches, one that can 
<i>seriously</i> mess up your spreadsheets.
</p>
<p>
Since each base-<i>N</i> system is equivalent, you can do this just 
as well in binary. &pi; in binary is:
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<col span=9 width=16>
<tr align="center">
  <th>exp
  <td> 3 <td> 2 <td> 1 <th> 0 <td> -1 <td> -2 <td> -3 <td> -4 <td> ...
<tr align="center">
  <th>pow
  <td> 8 <td> 4 <td> 2 <th> 1
  <td> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>   <td> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
  <td> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> <td> <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>
  <td> ...
<tr align="center">
  <th>&pi;
  <td> 0 <td> 0 <td> 1 <th> 1 <td> 0 <td> 0 <td> 1 <td> 0 <td> ...
</table>
</div>

<p>
So &pi; in binary is 11.0010<sub>bin</sub>. Well, yes and no. 
Unfortunately, 11.0010<sub>bin</sub> is actually 3.1250, not 3.1416. 
The problem here is that with 4 bits you
can only get a precision to the closest 1/16 = 0.0625. For 4 decimals 
of accuracy you'd need about 12 bits (11.001001000100 &asymp; 3.1416).
You could also use hex instead of binary, in which case the number is
3.243Fh.
<!--
The problem here is that real numbers often extend indefinitely.
-->
</p>


<h4>Conversion between bases</h4>
<p>
You might wonder how I got these conversions. It's actually not that
hard: all you have to do is divide by the base number and strip off
the remainders until you have nothing left; the string of the remainders
is the converted number. Converting decimal 1110 to hex, for example, 
would go like this:
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 rules=cols>
<tr><th> num  <th> / 16 <th> %16
<tr><td> 1110 <td> 69   <td> 6
<tr><td>   69 <td> 4    <td> 5
<tr><td>    4 <td> 0    <td> 4
<tr><th>result:<td colspan=2>456h
</table>
</div>

<p>
This strategy will also work for floating point numbers, but it may be 
smart to break the number up in an integer and fractional part first. 
And remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by 
its reciprocal. Grab your calculator and try it.
</p>
<p>
There are actually a number of different ways you can
convert between bases. The one given using divisions is the easiest 
one to program, but probably also the slowest.  This is especially 
true for the GBA, which has no hardware division. You can read about
another strategy over 
<a href="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/bcd/decimal.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>


<h4 id="num-sci">Scientific notation</h4>
<p>
Another thing that a positional system is useful for is what is known as 
the <dfn>scientific notation</dfn> of numbers. This will help you get 
rid of all the excess zeros that plague big and large numbers, as well 
as indicate the number of significant figures. For example, if you look
in science books, you might read that
<!-- the distance from the Earth to the
Sun is 149,600,000,000 meters. No wait, I've got a better example:
-->
the
mass of the Earth is 5,974,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg. There are two
things wrong with this number. First, the value itself is incorrect: it
isn't 59742 followed by 20 zeros kilograms, right down to the last
digit: that kind of accuracy just isn't possible in physics 
(with the possible exception of Quantum Mechanics, where theory can be
accurate to up to a staggering 14 decimals. That's right, that
&lsquo;fuzzy&rsquo; stuff actually has the highest degree of accuracy of
<i>all</i> fields of science).
When it comes to planetary masses, the first 3 to 5 numbers may be
accurate, the rest is usually junk. The second problem is more obvious: 
the number is just too damn long to write!
</p>
<p>
The scientific notation solves both problems. Multiplying with a power
of 10 effectively moves the floating point around and thus can
rid you of the zeros. The mass of the Earth can then be written
concisely as 5.9742·10<sup>24</sup>, that is, 5.9742 times 10 to the
power 24. You can also come across the even shorter notation of 
5.9742e+24, where the &ldquo;·10^&rdquo; is replaced by an 
&lsquo;e&rsquo; for exponent. Don't misread it as a hexadecimal number. 
And yes, I am aware that this is a shorthand notation of a shorthand 
notation. What can I say, math people are lazy bastards. Additionally, 
this number also indicates that you have 5 significant digits, and any
calculation you do afterwards needs to respect that.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this notation will work for any base number, just remember 
that conversion between bases require the whole number.
<!--
Keep this notation in the back of your mind, because I'll use it a 
couple of times lateron.
-->
</p>


<h4>It ain't as hard as you think</h4>
<p>
The concepts laid out in this section may seem difficult, but I assure 
you they are actually quite easy to understand. All of this stuff is 
taught in elementary or high school, the only thing is that they only 
use the decimal system there. Like I said, the workings of the
positional system is equivalent for all base numbers, the only 
difference is that you've had lots and lots of <i>practice</i> with 
the decimal system, and hardly any with the others. If you had
memorised the multiplication tables in hex instead of in decimal, 
you'd have found the latter awkward to use.
</p>


<!-- ============================================================== -->

<h2 id="sec-bits">A.2.
  Of bits and bytes</h2>
<p>
Any self-respecting programmer knows that the workings of a computer 
are all about little switches that can be on or off. This means that 
computers are more suited to a binary (or maybe hex) representation 
than a decimal one. Each switch is called a <dfn>bit</dfn>; computer
memory is basically a sea of millions upon millions of bits. To make
things a little more manageable, bits are often grouped into
<dfn>bytes</dfn>. 1 byte = 8 bits is the standard nowadays, but some 
older systems had 6-, 7-, or 9-bit bytes.
</p>
<p>
Since <i>everything</i> is just 1s and 0s, computers are the best
example on the meaning of symbols: it's all about interpretation here.
The bits can be used to mean anything: besides switches and numbers you
can interpret them as letters, colors, sound, you name it. In this
section, I will explain a few ways that you can interpret bits. I will 
often use a mixture of binary and hex, switching between them for 
convenience.
</p>


<h3 id="ssec-bits-int">A.2.1.
  Integer number representations</h3>
<p>
An obvious use of bits would be numbers, especially integers. With
8 bits, you have 2<sup>8</sup>=256 different numbers running from 0 to
1111,1111<sub>bin</sub> (FFh in hex and 255 decimal). That's not much,
so there are also groupings of 16 bits (10000h, 65536 numbers) and
32 bits (10000:0000h 4,294,967,296 numbers). PCs are now starting to
make the transition to 64 bits CPUs, I'm not even going to write down
how much that is. The C types for these are <b>short</b> (16bits),
<b>int</b> or <b>long</b> (32bits), and <b>long long</b> (64bits). 
The size of an int is actually system dependent, but on a GBA, it's
32bits.
</p>


<h4 id="bits-int-neg">Negative numbers</h4>
<p>
That you have <i>n</i> bits to represent a number does not necessarily
mean that you have to use them for the range [0, 2<sup>n</sup>&minus;1],
i.e. positive integers. What about negative numbers? Well, there
are a number of ways you can represent negative numbers. A very simple 
way could be to use one of the bits as a <dfn>sign bit</dfn>:  0 for
positive numbers and 1 for negative numbers. For example, binary 
1000,0001 could be &lsquo;&minus;1&rsquo;. Could be, but it isn't, 
because there's a smarter way.
</p>
<p>
Let's bring out our odometers again. In an three-digit odometer, you could
go from 0 to 999. Forget what a three-digit odometer says about the
quality of the car, just focus on the numbers. At 999,
<i>every</i> digit will roll over and you'll be back at 0 again. You
could also argue that the number <i>before</i> 0 is 999. In other
words, '999' would be the representation of &minus;1. You could split
the full one thousand range into one half for the first positive five
hundred (0 to 499), and the other for the first negative five hundred
(&minus;500 to &minus;1), as counting backward from 0, using the
roll-over. This type of numbering is called  be <dfn>tens'
complement</dfn>. The table below shows how this works for 3 digits.
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table id="tbl-10cmpl"
  border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<caption align="bottom">
  <b>Table 4</b>: tens' complement for 3 digits
</caption>
<tbody align="center">
<tr><th>Number
  <td>-500 <td>-499 <td>-498 <td> ...  <td>-2   <td>-1
  <td>0    <td>1    <td> ... <td> 497  <td> 498 <td> 499

<tr><th>Representation
  <td> 500 <td> 501  <td> 502 <td> ... <td> 998 <td> 999
  <td> 0   <td> 1    <td> ... <td> 497 <td> 498 <td> 499
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
That's the practice, now the theory behind it. Negative numbers are
deeply tied to subtraction; you could almost consider it part of their
definition. Basically, for every number <i>x</i>, the following should
be true:
</p>

<table id="eq-zero">
<tr><td class="eqnrcell">(2)<td class="eqcell">
  0 = <i>x</i> + (&minus;<i>x</i>)
</table>

<p>
This could be considered zeros' complement: the number 
(&minus;<i>x</i>) is the number you need to add to <i>x</i> to get 0.
In tens' complement, they need to add up to 10 or a power of 10.
In our odometer, 1000 will have the same representation as 0, and 
counting back from one thousand will be the same as counting back from
zero. However, you <i>must</i> know the number of digits beforehand;
otherwise it won't work. The actual representation of -<i>x</i> using
<i>m</i> digits, can be derived as follows:
</p>

<table id="eq-cmpl-def">
<tr>
  <td class="eqnrcell">(3)
  <td class="eqcell">
  <table class="eqtbl" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
  <col align="right">
  <col align="center">
  <col align="left">
  <tr>
    <td> 0
    <td>=
    <td> <i>x</i> + (&minus;<i>x</i>)
  <tr><td colspan=3 align="center">is equivalent to
  <tr>
    <td> 10<sup>m</sup>
    <td>=
    <td> <i>x</i> + (&minus;<i>x</i>)
  <tr>
    <td> (10<sup>m</sup>&minus;1) &minus; x + 1
    <td>=
    <td> (&minus;<i>x</i>)
  </table>
</table>

<p>
Don't panic, these equations aren't as nasty as they seem. Remember
that for <i>m</i> digits, the highest number is 10<sup>m</sup>&minus;1.
If <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, then that'd be 999 in decimal, 111 in 
binary or FFF in hex. This will allow you to do the subtraction 
by <i>x</i> without borrowing. There's more to 10s' complement then a 
way to express negative numbers, it'll also turn subtraction into a 
form of addition: <i>subtraction</i> by <i>y</i> is equivalent to
<i>addition</i> by its 10s' complement. That feature was part of the 
system from the start, and the other schemes of negative number 
representations don't have that property. Checking this is left as an 
exercise for the reader.
</p>
<p>
The binary version of 10s' complement is <dfn>twos' complement</dfn>.
Finding the twos' complement of a number is actually easier than in
other cases: the subtraction of 10<sup>m</sup>&minus;1 by <i>x</i> is
just the inversion of all the bits of <i>x</i>. Take 76, for example:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <td class="fill">&nbsp;
  <td class="eqcell">
  <table class="eqtbl" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
  <col align="right">
  <col align="center">
  <col align="left">
  <tr>
    <th>255: <td>1111 1111 <td>
  <tr>
    <th class="bdrB">76:
	<td class="bdrB">0100 1100 
	<td class="bdrB">&minus;
  <tr>
    <th>179:
    <td>1011 0011
  </table>
</table>

<p>
The 8bit &minus;76 would be 179+1=180 (10110100<sub>bin</sub>) and you 
will indeed see that 180+76 = 256 = 2<sup>8</sup>, exactly as it should
be.
</p>


<h4 id="bits-int-sign">Signed is not unsigned</h4>
<p>
I've already mentioned this before, but it's important enough to state 
it again: when using 10s' complement, you <i>must</i> know the number 
of digits ahead of time, otherwise you won't know what to subtract 
<i>x</i> from. Most of the time you can remain blissfully ignorant of
this fact, but there are a few instances where it really does matter.
In C or assembly programming, you have two types of integer numbers:
<dfn>signed</dfn> and <dfn>unsigned</dfn>, and only the <i>signed</i>
types are in twos' complement. The difference manifests itself in the
interpretation of the most significant bit: in unsigned numbers, it's 
just another bit. But in signed numbers, it acts as a sign-bit, and as 
such it needs to be preserved in certain operations as 
<i>type-casting</i> or <i>shifting</i>. For example, an 8bit FFh is
a signed &lsquo;&minus;1&rsquo; or an unsigned &lsquo;255&rsquo;. When 
converting to 16bits, the former should become FFFFh, while the latter 
would remain 00FFh. If you ever see stuff go completely bonkers when 
numbers become negative, this might be why.
</p>
<p>
Here are a few guidelines for choosing signed or unsigned types.
Intrinsically signed types are numbers that have a physical counterpart:
position, velocity, that kind of stuff. A key feature of these is that
you're supposed to do arithmetic on them. Variables that act as switches
are usually unsigned, the bitflags for enabling features on a GBA are
primary examples. These usually use logical operations like masking and
inverting (see the section on <a href="#sec-bitops">bit operations</a>).
Then there are quantities and counters. These can be either signed or
unsigned, but consider starting with signed, then switch to unsigned
if you really have to. Again, these are just recommendations, not
commandments that will land you in eternal damnation if you break them.
</p>

<div class="note">
Unsigned and signed types can behave differently under type casting,
comparison and bit-operations. A byte <i>x</i> containing FFh could
mean a signed &minus;1 or an unsigned 255. In that case:

<div class="lblock">
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<tr><td>FFh	<th>signed 		<th>unsigned
<tr><th>comparison x&lt;0
  <td>true <td> false
<tr><th>conversion to 16 bit
  <td>FFFFh (-1) <td> 00FFh (255)
<tr><th>shift right by 1
  <td>FFh (-1) <td> 7Fh (127)
</table>
</div>

</div>

<h3 id="ssec-bits-char">A.2.2.
  Characters</h3>
<p>
No, I'm not talking about GBA-tiles, but the letter variety (this
possible confusion is why I'm not fond of the name
&lsquo;character&rsquo; for tiles). For everyday purposes you would 
need 2*26 letters, 10 numerals, a bunch of punctuation signs and 
maybe a few extra things on the side: that's about 70 characters at 
least, so you'd need 7 bits to indicate them all (6 would only allow 
2<sup>6</sup>=64 characters). Better make it 8 bits for possible 
future expansion, and because it's a nice round number. In binary that 
is. That's part of the reason why the byte is a handy grouping: one 
character per byte.
</p>

<h4>Ascii</h4>
<p>
Knowing which characters you need is only part of the story: you also
need to assign them to certain numbers. The order of any alphabet is,
again, just a convention (well, there are orders that are more logical 
than others, see Tolkien's <i>Tengwar</i>, 
&ldquo;Lord of the Rings&rdquo;, Appendix E, but the Latin alphabet is 
completely random). One possible arrangement is to take a normal 
keyboard and work your way through the keys. Fortunately, this isn't the
standard. The common code for character assignments is
<dfn>ASCII</dfn>: <i>American Standard Code for Information
Interchange</i>.
</p>
<p>
The lower 128 characters of ASCII are given below. The
first 32 are control codes. Only a few of these are still of any
importance: 
08h (backspace, &lsquo;\b&rsquo;), 
09h (tab, &lsquo;\t&rsquo;),
0Ah (Line Feed, &lsquo;\n&rsquo;) and
0Dh (Carriage Return, &lsquo;\r&rsquo;). If you have ever
downloaded text files from Unix/Linux servers, you might have noticed
that all the line breaks have been removed: this is because DOS/Windows
uses CRLF (&lsquo;\n\r&rsquo;) as the line break, while Unix 
environments just use the line feed.
</p>
<p>
The real characters start at 20h, the space character. Note how the
numeric, uppercase and lowercase characters are located sequentially
and in a logical fashion. Numbers start at 30h, uppercase at 41h,
lowercase at 61h. The alphabetical order of the letters makes for easy
alphabetizing, although I should point out that the 32 difference
between uppercase and lowercase may cause problems.
</p>
<p>
The ASCII set also has an upper 128 characters, but these can be
different for different language settings. Normally, these will
include accented characters that are frequent in non-English
languages. In a DOS environment, they also contained a number of
purely graphical characters for borders and the like. ASCII isn't the
only character set available. Chinese and Japanese languages usually
use the 16bit <dfn>Unicode</dfn>, as the 8bit ASCII simply isn't
sufficient for thousands of characters. ASCII is basically a subset of 
Unicode.
</p>
<p>
The C type for the character is called <dfn>char</dfn>. A <b>char</b> is
actually a <i>signed</i> 8bit integer. I mention this because I
distinctly remember being sent on a long bughunt long ago because of 
this little fact. To be perfectly honest, I think that the default 
signing of the char-type is actually platform dependent, so consider 
yourself warned.

  IEEE(k)! Floating points</h3>
<p>
The last of the most common types is the floating point. Having, say,
32bits for a number is nice and all, but it still means you are
limited to around 4 billion characters. This may seem like a big
number, but we've already seen numbers that are much bigger. The
floating-point types provide a solution, using the scientific notation
in binary. I already described
<a href="#num-float">floating point</a> numbers (even in binary), as
well as the <a href="#num-sci">scientific notation</a>, so I won't
repeat how they work.
</p>
<p>
Describing floating-point numbers on a computer is done according to
the <dfn>IEEE/ANSI</dfn> standard (Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers / American National Standards Institute). The
floating-point format consists of 3 parts, a sign bit <i>s</i>, an
exponent <i>e</i> and a fractional part <i>f</i>.  The following
table and equation is the formatting and meaning of a normal, 32bit
float

    <i>x</i> = (&minus;1)<sup><i>s</i></sup> &times; 1.<i>f</i> &times;
    2<sup><i>e</i>&minus;127</sup>
</table>

<p>
Note that unlike signed integers, there <i>is</i> a real sign bit this
time. Furthermore, the number always starts with 1, and the fractional
part <i>f</i> really is the fractional part of the number. 
This makes sense, because sense, since if it weren't, you can always
move the point around until you get a single 1 before the point.

The exponent is subtracted by 127
to allow for negative powers (similar, but not exactly like you'd get
in a 2s' complement number). Two examples:
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr align="center"><th>x <th>s <th> e <th> f
<tr><th>1.0  <td>0 <td>01111111 <td> 000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
<tr><th>&minus;1.0 <td>1 <td>01111111 <td> 000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
</table>
</div>

<p>
Eq 4 will hold for the usual causes, but there are a few exceptions
to this rule.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If <b>e = f = 0</b>, then <i>x</i> = 0. Note that the sign-bit
	can still be set to indicate a left-limit to zero.
  <li>
    If <b>e = 0</b> and <b>f &ne; 0</b>, then the number is too small
	to be normalized, <i>x</i> = (&minus;1)<sup><i>s</i></sup> &times;
	0.<i>f</i> &times; 2<sup>&minus;127</sup>
  <li>
    If <b>e = 255</b> and <b>f = 0</b>, then the <i>x</i> = +&infin; or
	<i>x</i>= &minus;&infin;
  <li>
    If <b>e = 255</b> and <b>f &ne; 0</b>, then <i>x</i> = NaN, or 
	<i>Not a Number</i>. &radic;&minus;1 would be NaN, for example.
</ul>

<p>
The 32bit <b>float</b> has a 23bit fractional part, meaning 24 bits of
precision. Each 10 bits mean roughly one decimal, so that 24 bits give
around 7 decimals of precision, which may or may not be enough for your
purposes. If you need more, there are also the 8 byte <b>double</b> and
and 10 byte <b>long double</b> types, which have more exponent and 
fractional bits.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As you can probably tell, the floating-point format isn't nearly as
easy to understand as an integer. Both arithmetic and int-float
conversion is tricky. This isn't just for us humans, but
computers can have a hard time with them too. PCs usually have a
separate floating-point unit (FPU) for just these numbers. The GBA,
however, does not. As such, the use of floating-point numbers is
<i>strongly</i> discouraged on this system. So does that mean that, if
we want to use fractions and decimals and such, we're screwed? No, the
solution to this particular problem is called fixed-point math, and
I'll explain that <a href="fixed.htm">here</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="ssec-bits-endian">A.2.4.
  AAaagghhh! The endians are coming!</h3>
<p>
There is one convention I have completely overlooked throughout this
chapter: <dfn>endianness</dfn>. This is about the reading order
numbers, bits and bytes. I have always just assumed that in a number,
the <i>left</i>most digit is the most significant number,
that is, the highest power of <i>N</i>. So 1025 is read as
one thousand twenty-five.
That's <dfn>big-endian</dfn>, so named because the big-end
(the highest power) goes first. There is also <dfn>little-endian</dfn>,
in which the little-end (lowest power) goes first. In that case, 1025
would be read as five thousand two hundred and one. Once again, it's a
trivial convention, but it matters greatly which one you use. Both have
their merits: speech is usually big-endian and our number system
reflects that (except in a few countries which place the ones before
the tens (five and twenty), which can be quite confusing). Arithmetic,
however, usually starts at the little-end, as do URLs.
</p>

<p>
Computer endianness plays a part in two areas: bit-order in a byte and
byte-order in a multi-byte type such as an int. Since the byte is
usually the smallest chunk you can handle, the bit-order is usually of
little concern. As a simple example, look at the int 0x11223344. This 
will be stored differently on different systems, see the table below. 
Try to think of what would happen if you save this in a file and then 
transfer that to a computer with a different endian-scheme.
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table id="tbl-endian"
  border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 width=30%>
<caption align="bottom">
  <b>Table 6</b>: storing 0x11223344
</caption>
<col span=5 align="center">
<tr><th>memory <th> 00 <th> 01 <th> 02 <th> 03
<tr><th>big    <td> 11 <td> 22 <td> 33 <td> 44
<tr><th>little <td> 44 <td> 33 <td> 22 <td> 11
</table>
</div>

<p>
So what should we use then? Well, that's just it: there is no real 
answer. A benefit of big-endian is that if we see a memory dump, the
numbers will be in the human reading-order. On the little-endian side, 
lower powers are in lower memory, which makes more sense
mathematically. Additionally, when you have a 16bit integer
<i>x</i> = 0x0012, when you cast its address to a 8bit pointer, the 
value will be preserved which, personally, I think is a good thing.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
  u8 *pc;
  <span class="keyw">short</span> i= <span class="num">0x0012</span>;
  pc= (u8*)&amp;i;
  <span class="cmt">// little endian: *pc = 0x12, fine</span>
  <span class="cmt">//    big endian: *pc = 0x00, whups</span>
</pre>

<p>
There is actually one place where you can see the bits-in-byte order: 
bitmaps. In particular, bitmaps with a bitdepths less than 8. A byte in 
a 4bpp bitmap will represent two pixels. In a BMP, the high-nybbles are 
the even pixels and low-nybbles the odd ones. GBA graphics work exactly 
the other way around. One could say that BMP bits are big-endian and GBA
bits are little-endian (<i>bytes</i>, however, are little-endian on
both PCs and GBA). Another endianness-related thing about bitmaps is the 
color order, RGB (red-green-blue), or BGR (blue-green-red). There are so 
many pitfalls here that I don't even want to get into this.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, there's one other field where endianness mucks things up: 
dates. In Europe we use a little-endian scheme: day-month-year. I hear 
that Japan uses big-endian dates: year-month-day. And then there's the 
English scheme, which just had to make things difficult for themselves 
by using a month-day-year scheme. This could be called middle endian, I 
suppose.
</p>
<br>

<p>
In the end it's not a matter of which is &lsquo;better&rsquo;, but
rather of which system you're working on. PCs and the GBA are
little-endian; I hear that Macs and a lot of other RISC chips are
big-endian (but I may be wrong here). Don't get dragged into any 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt" target="_blank">holy
wars</a> over this, just be aware that the different schemes exist and
be careful when porting code.

<h2 id="sec-bitops">A.3.
  Bit operations</h2>
<p>
As the name implies, bit operations (bit-ops) work at the individual
bit level and are therefore the lowest operations you can think of. 
Most Real World applications have little need for bit-fiddling and
therefore use bit-ops sparingly, if at all. A good number of
programming languages don't even have them. Assembly and C (and Java)
belong to the ones that do, but if you look at course books, bit
operations are usually moved to the back pages (yes, I am aware that
I'm doing this too, but remember that Tonc isn't meant as a general
programming tutorial; you should know this stuff already.
Most of it, anyway). As GBA programming is done very close to the 
hardware, with effects taking place depending on whether individual bits 
are set (1) or clear (0), a good understanding of bit operations is 
<i>essential</i>!
</p>
<p>
The basic list of bit-ops is: OR, AND, NOT, XOR, shift left/right,
rotate left/right. That's 8 operations, though someone proficient with
Occam's Razor could cut this list down to 5, perhaps even four items.
Of these, only OR, AND and XOR are &lsquo;true&rsquo; bit operations: 
they can be used to change the value of a single bit. The rest change 
all the bits
of a variable.
</p>


<h3 id="ssec-bitops-true">A.3.1.
  True bitwise bit operations</h3>
<p>
There are 3 bitwise operators: 
OR ( (inclusive or, symbol &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;),
AND (symbol &lsquo;|&rsquo;) and 
XOR (exclusive or, symbol &lsquo;^&rsquo;) ). These are
binary operators, as in &lsquo;taking two arguments as their
inputs&rsquo;. They're called
<dfn>bitwise</dfn> operators because that the <i>n</i>th bit of the
result is only affected by the <i>n</i>th bits of the operands.
AND and OR work pretty much as their logical counterparts (&amp;&amp; 
and ||). In <i>c</i>=<i>a</i>&amp;<i>b</i>, a bit in <i>c</i> will be
<code>1</code> only if that bit is <code>1</code> in both <i>a</i>
<i>and</i> <i>b</i>. For OR, the <i>a</i>-bit <i>or</i> <i>b</i>-bit
(or both) must be <code>1</code>. XOR doesn't have a logical
counterpart, but it is more closely linked to the Real Word
definition of &lsquo;or&rsquo;: XOR is <code>1</code> if <i>either</i>
the <i>a</i>-bit <i>or</i> the <i>b</i>-bit is <code>1</code> (but not
both).
</p>
<p>
There is a fourth operation that is often included in this group,
namely NOT (ones' complement, symbol &lsquo;~&rsquo;). NOT is a unary 
operator, and inverts all bits of the operand, which is basically 
XORring with &minus;1 (which is all <code>1</code>s in binary). The 
bitwise NOT is similar to the logical not (&lsquo;!&rsquo;). There is 
an important difference between the logical operations 
(&lsquo;&amp;&amp;&rsquo;, &lsquo;||&rsquo; and &lsquo;!&rsquo;)
and their bitwise counterparts 
(&lsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, &lsquo;|&rsquo; , &lsquo;~&rsquo;), 
try not to confuse them.
</p>
<p>
What these four operations do is usually written down in truth tables,
which list all possible input combinations and their results. Note that
the truth tables look at each bit individually, not the variable as a
whole, even though the operators themselves always act on variables. 
Table 8 shows examples of these operators on bytes 0Fh and 35h.

I hope you've noticed that some of the bits were colored. Yes, there 
was a point to this. Knowing what the bit-ops do is one thing;
knowing how to <i>use</i> them is another.
A bit is a binary switch, and there are four things you can do to a
switch: leave it alone, flip it, turn it on, and turn it off. In other 
words, you can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>keep</b> the current state,
  <li><b>toggle</b> it (0&rarr;1, 1&rarr;0),
  <li><b>set</b> it (<i>x</i>&rarr;1), and
  <li><b>clear</b> it (<i>x</i>&rarr;0)
</ul>

<p>
If you look at the truth tables and the examples, you may already see 
how this can work. OR, AND, XOR are binary operators, and you can 
think of the two operands as a source variable <i>s</i> and a 
<dfn>mask</dfn> variable <i>m</i> which tells you which of the bits are 
affected. In table 8a I used <i>s</i>=35h and <i>m</i>=0Fh; the mask
consists of the set bits (in blue), the red bits were the ones that were 
affected. If you examine the table, you'll see that an OR sets bits, a 
XOR toggles it and an AND keeps bits (i.e., clears the unmasked bits). 
To clear the masked bits, you'd need to invert the mask first, so that 
would be an <i>s</i> AND NOT <i>m</i> operation. Note that the first 
three are commutative (
<i>s</i>&nbsp;OP&nbsp;<i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>m</i>&nbsp;OP&nbsp;<i>s</i>
), but the last one isn't. This masking interpretation of the bit 
operations is very useful, since you'll often be using them to change 
the bits of certain registers in just this way, using C's assignment
operators like '|='.

  Non-bitwise bit operations</h3>
<p>
And then there are the shift and rotate operations. In contrast to the 
earlier operations, these act on a variable as a whole. Each variable 
is a string of bits and with the shift and rotate operations you can 
move the bits around. Both have left and right variants and are 
binary operations, the first operand is the source number, and 
the second is the amount of bits to move. I'll refer to shift 
left/right as SHL and SHR and rotate left/right as ROL and ROR for 
now. These sound like assembly instructions, but they're not. At least, 
not ARM assembly. Shift left/right have C operators 
&lsquo;&lt;&lt;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo;, but
there are no C operators for a bit-rotate, although you can construct 
the effect using shifts. As said, shift and rotate move bits around a 
variable, in pretty much the way you'd expect:

<p>
Shifting has two uses. First of all, you can easily find the <i>n</i>
bit, or the <i>n</i>th power of 2 by using 
<code>1&lt;&lt;</code><i>n</i>. Speaking of powers, shifting basically 
comes down to adding zeros or removing bits, which is essentially
multiplying or dividing by 10. Binary 10, that is. So you could use
shifting to quickly multiply or divide by 2. The latter is especially
useful, since division if very, very costly on a GBA, while shifting is 
a one-cycle operation. I can't really thing of a
use for rotation right now but I'm sure they're there.
</p>
<br>
<p>
OK, that's what they do in theory. In <i>practice</i>, however,
there's a lot more to it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that
the size of the variable is important. A rotate on an 8bit variable
will be very different then a rotate on a 16bit one. There is also
the possibility of including the carry bit in the rotation, but that 
doesn't really matter for the moment because bit rotation is purely an 
assembly matter, and that's beyond the scope of this page.
</p>
<p>
What does matter is a few nasty things about shifting. Shift-left isn't 
much of a problem, unless you shift by more than the amount of bits of 
the variable. Shift-right, however, has one particular nasty issue for 
negative numbers. For example, an 8bit &minus;2 is represented in
twos' complement by <code>FEh</code>. If you shift-right by one, you'd
get <code>7Fh</code>, which is 128, and not 
&minus;2/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;&minus;1. The problem here is that the first bit 
acts as a sign bit, and should have special significance. When shifting-
right, the sign-bit needs to be preserved and extended to the other 
bits, this will ensure that the result is both negative and represents a 
division by a power of two. There are actually two right-shift 
instructions, the <i>arithmetic</i> and the <i>logical</i> shift right 
(ASR and LSR); the former extends the sign bit, the latter doesn't.
In C, the <a href="numbers.htm#bits-int-sign">signing</a> of the
variable type determines which of these instructions is used.
</p>
<p>
Take the interesting case of the 8bits 80h, which is both the
unsigned 128 as the signed &minus;128. A right-shift by 3 should result 
in 16 and &minus;16, respectively. This would be 10h for the unsigned 
and F0h for the signed case, and lo and behold, that is exactly what 
you'd get by sign-bit extension or not.

I know this seems like such a small and trivial issue, and indeed, it
usually is. But when it isn't, you could be looking at a long
bughunt. This isn't limited to just shifting, by the way, <i>all</i>
bit operations can suffer from this problem.
</p>


<h3 id="ssec-bitops-arith">A.3.3.
  Arithmetic with bit operations</h3>
<p>
The shift operators can be used to divide and multiply by powers of
two. The other bit-ops also have arithmetic interpretations. 
</p>
<p>
For example, a modulo of a power of two basically cuts away the upper
bits, which can be done with an AND operation:
<i>x</i>%2<sup>n</sup> = <i>x</i>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;2<sup>n</sup>&minus;1.
For example, <i>x</i>%8 = <i>x</i>&amp;7. 
</p>
<p>
An OR operation can be used as an addition, but <i>only</i> if the 
affected bits were 0 to start with. 
F0h&nbsp;|&nbsp;01h&nbsp;=&nbsp;F1h, which is the same as F0h+01h.
However, F0h&nbsp;|&nbsp;11h&nbsp;=&nbsp;F1h too, but F0h+11h is 
actually 101h. Be careful with this one, and make note of it when you 
see it in other people's code.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to <a href="#bits-int-neg">twos' complement</a>, we can use XOR 
as a subtraction:
(2<sup>n</sup>&minus;1)&minus;<i>x</i> =
(2<sup>n</sup>&minus;1)&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;<i>x</i>.
This can be used to reverse the traversal order of loops, for example,
which can be useful when you want collision detection with flipped 
tiles. Yes, it's a bit of a hack, but so what?
</p>

<span class="keyw">int</span> ii, mask;

    ... array[ii^mask] ...
}
</pre>

<p>
OR and XOR are only very rarely used in their arithmetic form, but the 
shifts and AND can be seen with some regularity. This is especially 
true on a system with no hardware division (like the GBA), in which
case division and modulo are expensive operations. That is why powers 
of two are preferred for sizes and such, the faster bit operations can 
then be used instead. Fortunately, the compiler is smart enough to 
optimize, say, division by 8 to a right-shift by 3, so you don't have to
write down the bit-op version yourself if you don't want to. Mind you, 
this will only work if a) the second operand is a constant and b) that 
constant is a power of two.

And now for my final trick of the day, let's take a closer look at the 
most basic of arithmetic operations, addition. The addition of 2 bits 
to be precise, and the truthtable of that can be found in table 12 
below. If you've paid attention so far (well done! I didn't think anyone
would make it this far <kbd>:P</kbd>), there should be something
familiar about the two columns that make up the result. The right 
column is just <i>a</i>&nbsp;XOR&nbsp;<i>b</i> and the left column is
<i>a</i>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<i>b</i>. This means that you can create a 1-bit
adder with just an AND and a XOR port, electric components that can be
found in any Radio Shack, or its local equivalent. String 8 of these 
together for an 8-bit adder, and you'll have yourself the foundation of
an 8bit computer, cool huh?

  Beware of bit operations</h3>
<p>
There are two things you should <i>always</i> remember when you're using 
bit operations. I've already mentioned the first, that they can mess
with the sign of the variables. This is only relevant for signed
integers, though.
</p>
<p>
The second problem is concerns the level of precedence of the bit
operations. Except for NOT (&lsquo;~&rsquo;), the precedence is very 
low; lower than addition, for example, and even lower than conditional
operators in some cases. Your C manual should have a precedence list, 
so I'll refer you to that for details. In the mean time, be prepared to 
drown your code in parentheses over this.
