<h2 id="sec-intro">17.1.
  Introduction</h2>
<p>
Apart from <a href="interrupts.htm">hardware interrupts</a>, like 
HBlank and cartridge interrupts, there are also things called 
<dfn>software interrupts</dfn>, also known as <dfn>BIOS calls</dfn>. 
The software interrupts work very much like ordinary functions:
you set-up input, call the routine, and get some output back. 
The difference lies in how you reach the code; for normal functions 
you just, well, jump to the routine you want. Software interrupts
use the <code>swi</code> instruction, which diverts the program flow
to somewhere in BIOS, carries out the requested algorithm and then 
restores the normal flow of your program. This is similar to what 
hardware interrupts do, only now you raise the interrupt 
programmatically. Hence: software interrupt.
</p>
<p>
The GBA BIOS has 42 software interrupts, with basic routines for 
copying, math (division, square root), affine transformations for 
sprites and backgrounds, decompression among others. There are
also some very special functions like the <code>IntrWait</code>
routines, which can stop the CPU until a hardware interrupt occurs.
The VBlank variant is highly recommended, which is what makes this 
chapter important.
</p>
<p>
Using software interrupts isn't too hard if it weren't for one 
thing: the <code>swi</code> instruction itself. This again requires 
some assembly. However, not <i>much</i> assembly, and it's easy to 
write C wrappers for them, which we'll also cover here.
</p>


<!-- ============================================================== -->

<h2 id="sec-funs">17.2.
  The BIOS functions</h2>
<p>
Calling the BIOS functions can be done via the 
&lsquo;<code>swi <i>n</i></code>&rsquo; instruction, where <i>n</i> 
is the BIOS call you want to use. Mind you, the exact numbers you need 
to use depends 
on whether your code is in ARM or THUMB state. In THUMB the argument 
is simply the <i>n</i> itself, but in ARM you need to use 
<i>n</i>&lt;&lt;16. Just like normal functions, the BIOS calls can have 
input and output. The first four registers (r0-r3) are used for this 
purpose; though the exact purpose and the number of registers differ 
for each call.
</p>

<p>
Here's a list containing the names of each BIOS call. I am not going
to say what each of them does since other sites have done that already 
and it seems pointless to copy their stuff verbatim. For full 
descriptions go 
to <a href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm" target="_blank">GBATek</a>, for 
example. I will give a description of a few of them so you can get a 
taste of how they work.

  Div, Sqrt, Arctan2 and  ObjAffineSet descriptions</h3>

<dl>
<dt>0x06: Div</dt>
<dd>
Input:
  <p>r0: numerator</p>
  <p>r1: denominator</p>
 Output:
  <p>r0: numerator / denominator</p>
  <p>r1: numerator % denominator</p>
  <p>r3: abs(numerator / denominator)</p>
 Note: do NOT divide by zero!
<br>
</dd>

<dt>0x08: Sqrt</dt>
<dd>
Input:
  <p>r0: num, a unsigned 32-bit integer</p>
Output:
  <p>r1: sqrt(num)</p>
<br>
</dd>

<dt>0x0a: ArcTan2</dt>
<dd>
Input:
  <p>r0: <i>x</i>, a <b>signed 16bit</b> number (<code>s16</code>)</p>
  <p>r1: <i>y</i>, a <b>signed 16bit</b> number (<code>s16</code>)</p>
Output:
  <p>r0: 
    <i>x</i>&ge;0 : <i>&theta;</i>= arctan(<i>y/x</i>) &or;
    <i>x</i>&lt;0 : <i>&theta;</i>= 
      sign(<i>y</i>)*(&pi; &minus; arctan(|<i>y/x</i>|).<br>
  </p>
    This does the full inverse of <i>y</i> = <i>x</i>*tan(&theta;).
    The problem with the tangent is that the domain is a semi-circle,
    as is the range of arc tangent. To get the full circle range, both
    <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values are required for not only their 
    quotient, but their signs as well. The mathematical range of
    <i>&theta;</i> is [&minus;&pi;,&nbsp;&pi;&rang;, which corresponds
    to [&minus;0x8000,&nbsp;0x8000&rang; (or
    [0,&nbsp;2&pi;&rang; and [0,&nbsp;0xFFFF] if you like)
<br>
</dd>

<dt>0x0f: ObjAffineSet</dt>
<dd>
Input:
  <p>r0: source address</p>
  <p>r1: destination address</p>
  <p>r2: number of calculations</p>
  <p>r3: Offset of <b>P</b> matrix elements (2 for bgs,
    8 for objects)</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The source address points to an array of <code>AFF_SRC</code>
structs (also known as <code>ObjAffineSource</code>, which 
is a bit misleading since you can use them for backgrounds 
as well). The <code>AFF_SRC</code> struct consist of two 
scales <i>s</i><sub>x</sub> , <i>s</i><sub>y</sub> and an
angle &alpha;, which again uses the range [0,&nbsp;0xFFFF] for 
2&pi;. The resulting <b>P</b>:
</p>

<table id="eq-pswi">
<tr>
  <td class="eqnrcell">(17.1)
  <td class="eqcell"> <b>P</b> =
  <td class="eqcell">
  <table class="eqtbl" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
  <tbody align="center">
  <tr>
    <td class="bdrLL" rowspan=2>&nbsp;
    <td><i>s</i><sub>x</sub>&middot;cos(&alpha;)
    <td>&nbsp;
    <td>&minus;<i>s</i><sub>x</sub>&middot;sin(&alpha;)
    <td class="bdrRR" rowspan=2>&nbsp;
  <tr>
    <td><i>s</i><sub>y</sub>&middot;sin(&alpha;)
    <td>&nbsp;
    <td><i>s</i><sub>y</sub>&middot;cos(&alpha;)
  </tbody>
  </table>
</table>

<p>
By now you should know what this does: it scales horizontally by 
1/<i>s</i><sub>x</sub>, vertically by 1/<i>s</i><sub>y</sub> followed 
by a counter-clockwise rotation by <i>&alpha;</i>. 
<code>ObjAffineSet()</code> does almost exactly what 
<code>obj_aff_rotscale()</code> and <code>bg_aff_rotscale()</code> do, 
except that <code>ObjAffineSet()</code> can also set multiple 
matrices at once.
</p>
<p>
The source data is kept in <code>ObjAffineSource</code> (i.e., 
<code>AFF_SRC</code>) structs. Now, as the routine sets affine 
matrices, you might think that the destinations are either 
<code>OBJ_AFFINE</code> or <code>ObjAffineDest</code> 
structs. However, you'd be wrong. Well, partially anyway. 
The problem is that the destination always points to a 
<i>p</i><sub>a</sub>-element, which is not necessarily the first 
element in struct. You <i>will</i> make the mistake of 
simply supplying an <code>OBJ_AFFINE</code> pointer when you try 
to use it to fill those. Don't say I didn't warn you.
</p>
<p>
Two other things need to be said here as well. First, once 
again we have a bit of a misnomer: ObjAffineSet doesn't really have 
much to do with objects per se, but can be used in that 
capacity by setting <code>r3</code> to 8 instead of 2. The 
second is that the routine can also be used to set up multiple arrays 
via <code>r2</code>. However, <i>be careful</i> when you do this 
with devkitPro 19. <code>ObjAffineSet()</code> expects its source 
structs to be <a href="bitmaps.htm#ssec-data-align">word-aligned</a>, 
which they won't be unless you add the alignment attributes yourself.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="cmt">// Source struct. Note the alignment!</span>
<span class= keyw>typedef struct</span> AFF_SRC
{
    s16 sx, sy;
    u16 alpha;

    u16 fill3[<span class= num>3</span>];    s16 pd;
} ALIGN4 OBJ_AFFINE;
</pre>

<p>
Now I should say that the names I use for the actual functions are 
a little bit different from the conventional ones. My names are all 
prefixed by <code>swi_</code> and then a lower-case indicator for the 
specific function. I've added definitions to <tt>swi.h</tt> that will 
allow you to use the official names as well, but I try to use my own.

  Assembly for BIOS calls</h3>
<p>
You might think this whole discussion was rather pointless since you 
can't access the registers and the <code>swi</code> instruction 
unless you use assembly, which will be pretty tough, right? Well, no, 
yes and no. The necessary assembly steps for BIOS calls are actually 
rather simple, and are given below.
</p>


<pre class="proglist" id="cd-swi-asm">
<span class="cmt">@ In tonc_bios.s</span>

<span class="cmt">@ at top of your file</span>
    .text           <span class="cmt">@ aka .section .text</span>
    .code <span class="num">16</span>        <span 
class="cmt">@ aka .thumb</span>

<span class="cmt">@ for each swi (like division, for example)</span>
    .align <span class="num">2</span>        <span

    .global Div
    .thumb_func
Div:
    swi     <span class="num">0x06</span>
    bx      lr
</pre>

<p>
This is assembly code for the GNU assembler (GAS); for Goldroad or 
ARM STD the syntax is likely to be slightly different. The first thing 
you need to do is give some <dfn>directives</dfn>, which tells some 
details about the following code. In this case, we use the 
&lsquo;<code>.text</code>&rsquo; to put the code in the 
<code>text</code> section (ROM or EWRAM for multiboot). We also say that 
the code is THUMB code by using &lsquo;<code>.code 16</code>&rsquo; 
or &lsquo;<code>.thumb</code>&rsquo;. If you place these at the top 
of the file, they'll hold for the rest of the thing. For each 
BIOS call, you'll need the following 6 items.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Word-alignment</b>. 
  Or at least halfword alignment, but words 
  are probably preferable. There are two directives for this, 
  <code>.align <i>n</i></code> and <code>.balign <i>m</i></code>. 
  The former aligns to 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> so requires 
  &lsquo;<code>.align 2</code>&rsquo;; the latter aligns to <i>m</i> 
  so you can just use &lsquo;<code>balign <i>m</i></code>&rsquo;. 
  Note that both will only work on the <i>next</i> piece of code 
  or data and no further, which is why it's best to add it for each 
  function.
<li><b>Scope</b>. 
  The <code>.global <i>name</i></code> directive makes a symbol out 
  of <i>name</i>, which will then be visible for other files in the 
  project as well. A bit like <code>extern</code> or, rather, an 
  anti-<code>static</code>.
<li><b>Thumb indicator</b>
  It would seem that <code>.code 16</code> alone isn't enough, you 
  also need <code>.thumb_func</code>. In fact, if I read the manual 
  correctly this one also implies <code>.code 16</code>, which would 
  make that directive redundant.
<li><b>Label</b>.
  &lsquo;<i>name</i>:&rsquo; marks where the symbol <i>name</i> 
  starts. Obviously, to use a function it must actually exist.
<li><b>BIOS call</b>
  To actually activate the BIOS call, use &lsquo;swi <i>n</i>&rsquo;, 
  with <i>n</i> the BIOS call you want.
<li><b>Return</b>
  And we're practically done already, all we have to do now is return 
  to the caller with &lsquo;bx lr&rsquo;.
</ul>

<p>
See? It's really not that complicated. Sometimes you might want a 
little more functionality than this, but for the most part you only 
need two measly instructions.
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-use-aapcs">17.3.2.
  The Arm Architecture Procedure Call Standard</h3>
<p>
That's all fine and good, but that still leaves the questions of a) 
how do I combine this with C code and b) where'd all the input and 
output go? The answer to the first is simple: just add a function 
declaration like usual:
</p>

<pre class="proglist" id="cd-swi-decl">
<span class="cmt">// In tonc_bios.h</span>

<span class="keyw">int</span> Div(<span 
class="keyw">int</span> num, <span class="keyw">int</span> denom);
</pre>

<p>
Mkay, but that <i>still</i> doesn't explain where my input and 
output went. Well actually &hellip; it <i>does</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;I am not sure how clouds get formed. But the clouds know 
how to do it, and that is the important thing&rdquo; 
</blockquote>

<p>
Found that quote 
long ago in one of those Kids on Science lists, and I'm always 
reminded of it when programming. The thing about computers is that 
they don't think in terms of input, output, text, pictures etc. 
Actually, they don't think at all, but that's another story. All a 
computer sees is data; not even code and data, just data since code 
is data too. Of course, <i>you</i> may not see it that way because 
you're used to C or VB or whatever, but when all is said and done, 
it's all just ones and zeros. If the ones and zeros come to the 
CPU via the program counter (<b>PC</b> register, <code>r15</code>) 
it's code, otherwise it's data.
</p>
<p>
So how does that explain the input/output? Well, it doesn't do it 
directly, but it points to how you should be looking at the situation. 
Consider you're the compiler and you have to convert some bloke's 
C code into machine code (or assembly, which is almost the same thing)
that a CPU can actually use. You come across the line 
&ldquo;<code>q= Div(x,y);</code>&rdquo;. What does <code>Div()</code> 
do? Well, if there's no symbol in the C-file for that name (and 
there isn't, as it's in <tt>tonc_bios.s</tt>), you wouldn't know. 
Technically, you don't even know <i>what</i> it is. But 
<code>Div</code> knows, and that's the important thing. At least, 
that's <i>almost</i> how it works. The compiler should still need 
to know what sort of critter 
<code>Div</code> is to avoid confusion: A variable? A macro? A 
function? That's what the declarations are for. And the declaration 
above says that <code>Div</code> is a function that expects two 
signed integers and returns one too. As far as the compiler's 
concerned, it ends there.
</p><br>


<p>
Of course, that still doesn't explain how the compiler knows 
what do to. Well, it simply follows the <i>ARM Architecture 
Procedure Call Standard</i>, <dfn>AAPCS</dfn> for short. This states 
how functions should pass arguments to each other. This PDF document 
can be found <a href="http://www.arm.com/miscPDFs/8031.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> 
and if you're contemplating assembly is a very worthwhile download.
</p>
<p>
For now, here's what you need to know. The first four arguments are
placed in the first four registers <code>r0-r3</code>, every one 
after that is placed on the stack. The output value is placed in 
<code>r0</code>. As long as you take the argument list of the BIOS 
call as the list in the declaration, it should work fine. Note that 
the declaration also takes care of any casting that needs to be 
done. It is important that you realize just what the declaration 
means here: <i>it</i> determines how the function is called, not 
the actual <i>definition</i> assembly function. Or even C function. 
Things can go very wrong if you mess up the declaration.
</p>
<p>
Another thing the AAPCS tells you is that register r0-r3 (and r12) 
are so-called <dfn>scratch</dfn> registers. This means that the 
caller <i>expects</i> the called function to mess these up. After 
the function returns their contents are to be considered undefined 
&ndash; unless you're the one writing both asm functions, in which 
case there may be certain &hellip; allowances. Having these as scratch 
registers means that a function can use them without needing to 
push and pop the originals on and off the stack, thus saving time. 
This does not hold for the other registers, though: r4-r11, r13, 
r14 <i>must</i> be returned in the way the calling function got 
them. The last one, r15, is exempt from this, as you shouldn't screw 
around with the program counter.
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-use-inl-asm">17.3.3.
  Inline assembly</h3>
<p>
Actually, you don't even need a full assembly file for BIOS calls: 
you could use <dfn>inline assembly</dfn>. With inline assembly, you can 
mix C code and assembly code. Since the functions are usually rather 
simple, you could use something like
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="cmt">// In a C file</span>
<span class="keyw">int</span> Div(<span class="keyw">int</span> num,<!--
--> <span class="keyw">int</span> denom)
{   asm(<span class="str">"swi 0x06"</span>);   }
</pre>
<p>
This does exactly the same thing as the assembly version of 
<code>Div</code>. However, you need to be careful with inline 
assembly because you can't see the code around it and might 
accidentally <dfn>clobber</dfn> some registers that you shouldn't 
be messing with, thus ruining the rest of the code. For the full 
rules on inline assembly, see the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html" target="_blank">GCC manual</a>. You can 
also find a short faq on inline assembly use at
<a href="http://www.devrs.com/gba/" target="_blank">devrs.com</a>. The 
&lsquo;proper&rsquo;
syntax of inline assembly isn't the friendliest in the world, mind 
you, and there are other problems as well. Consider the C function 
given above. Since it doesn't really do anything itself, the 
optimiser may be tempted to throw it away. This will happen with 
<tt>-O3</tt> unless you take appropriate precautions. Also, the 
compiler will complain that the function doesn't return anything, 
even though it should. It has a point, of course, considering that 
part is taken care of inside the assembly block. There are probably 
a few other problems that I'm not aware of at present; in the end 
it's easier to use the full-assembly versions so you know what's 
happening. 
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-use-swi-call">17.3.4.
  The <kbd>swi_call</kbd> macro</h3>
<p>
On the other hand, there are also BIOS calls that use no arguments, 
which can be run via a mere macro. The <code>swi_call(x)</code> 
macro will run the BIOS call <i>x</i>, and can be found in 
<tt>swi.h</tt>, and in Wintermute's 
<a href="http://www.devkitpro.org" target="_blank">libgba</a>, which is where I got it 
from. It's a little more refined than the <code>Div</code>
function given above. First, it uses the <code>volatile</code> 
keyword, which should keep your optimizer from deleting the function 
(just like we did for all the registers). Secondly, it uses a 
<dfn>clobber list</dfn> (after the triple colons). This will tell 
the compiler which registers are used by the inline assembly. Thirdly, 
it will take care of the THUMB/ARM switch automatically. If you use 
the <tt>-mthumb</tt> compiler option, the compiler will define 
<code>__thumb__</code> for us, which we will now use to get the 
right swi-number. Clever, eh?
</p>
<pre class="proglist">
<span class="keyw">#ifndef</span>(__thumb__)
<span class="keyw">#define</span> swi_call(x)   <!--
-->asm <span class="keyw">volatile</span>(<span 
class="str">"swi\t"</span>#x ::: "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3")
<span class="keyw">#else</span>
<span class="keyw">#define</span> swi_call(x)   <!--
-->asm <span class="keyw">volatile</span>(<span 
class="str">"swi\t"</span>#x"&lt;&lt;16" ::: "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3")
<span class="keyw">#endif</span>
</pre><br>

<p>
By the way, if you want more information about assembly, you can 
find a number of tutorials on ARM assembly at gbadev.org. Another 
nice way to learn is by using the <tt>-S</tt> compiler flag, which 
will give you a compiler-generated assembly file of your code. This 
will show you exactly what the compiler does to your code, including 
optimisation steps and use of the AAPCS. Really, you should see this 
at least once. 
</p>
<p>
It may also help to use <tt>-fverbose-asm</tt>, which will write out 
the original variable names and operations in comments. Usually in 
the right place too. Also handy is the <code>ASM_CMT()</code> macro 
shown below. This will give you some hints as to where specific 
blocks of code are. But again, not all the time.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">

<b>Fig 1</b>: div, sqrt, arctan2, sin and cos graphs, courtesy of BIOS.
</div>

<p>
To illustrate the use of BIOS calls I am using Div, Sqrt, ArcTan and 
ObjAffineSet to create graphs if a hyperbole, square root, sine and 
cosine. I've scaled them in such a way so that they fit nicely 
on the 240x160 screen. The definitions are
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>division	<td><i>y</i>= 2560/<i>x</i>
<tr><td>square root	<td><i>y</i>= 160*sqrt(<i>x</i>/240)
<tr><td>arctan  	<td><i>y</i>= 80 + 64*(2/&pi;)*(arctan(<i>x</i>-120)/16))
<tr><td>sine		<td><i>y</i>=  1*sy*sin(2&pi;·<i>x</i>/240)	<td>; sy= 80
<tr><td>cosine		<td><i>y</i>= 80*sx*cos(2&pi;·<i>x</i>/240)	<td>; sx= 1
</table>
<p>
and these functions have been plotted in fig&nbsp;1. If you're wondering
how I got the sine and cosine values, as there are no calls for those, 
take a look at eq&nbsp;1 again. The <b>P</b> matrix has them. I've used 
<i>p</i><sub>a</sub> for the cosine and <i>p</i><sub>c</sub> for the 
sine. Note that the graphs appear instantly; there is no sense of loading 
time while the graphs are plotted. An earlier version of the mode 7 demo
(or PERNs mode 7 demo) used calls to the actual division, sine and cosine
functions to build up the LUTs. Even with the symmetry rules of 
trigonometry, <code>sin()</code> and <code>cos()</code> are still noticeably 
slower than the BIOS equivalent.

<h2 id="sec-vsync2">17.5.
  Vsyncing part II, VBlankIntrWait</h2>
<p>
Until now, all demos used the function <code>vid_vsync</code> to 
synchronize the action to the VBlank (see the 
<a href="video.htm#sec-vsync1">graphics introduction</a>). What this 
did was to check <code>REG_VCOUNT</code> and stay in a while loop 
until the next VBlank came along. While it works, it's really a 
pretty poor way of doing things for two reasons. First, because of 
the potential problem when you are in a VBlank already, but that one 
had been covered. The second reason is more important: while you're 
in the while loop, you're wasting an awful lot of CPU cycles, all 
of which slurp battery power.
</p>

<div class="cpt_fr" style="width:240px;">
<img src="../img/demo/swi_vsync.png" id="img-swi-vsync" 
  alt="Fig 2: swi_vsync"><br>
<b>Fig 2</b>: <tt>swi_vsync</tt> demo.
</div>

<p>
There are a number of BIOS calls 
that can put the CPU into a low power mode, thus sparing the 
batteries.
The main BIOS call for this is Halt (#2), but what we're 
currently interested in is VBlankIntrWait (#5). This will set 
things up to wait until the next VBlank interrupt. To use it, you 
have to have interrupts switched on, of course, in particular the 
VBlank interrupt. As usual, the VBlank isr will have to acknowledge 
the interrupt by writing to <code>REG_IF</code>. But it <i>also</i> 
has to write to its BIOS equivalent, <code>REG_IFBIOS</code>. This 
little bit of information is a little hard to find elsewhere (in part 
because few tutorials cover BIOS calls); for more info, see <a 
href="http://nocash.emubase.de/gbatek.htm#bioshaltfunctions">GBATek,
BIOS Halt Functions</a>. Fortunately for us, the switchboard presented 
in the <a href="interrupts.htm#sec-switch">interrupts</a> section has 
this built in.
</p>
<p>
To show you how to set it up, see the <tt>swi_vsync</tt> demo. The
most important code is given below; a screen shot can be found in
fig&nbsp;2. What it does is give a rotating metroid sprite with an 
angular velocity of &pi; rad/s (this corresponds to &Delta;&theta; = 
0x10000/4/60= 0x0111). The basic steps for interrupt handling should 
be familiar, except the fact that there's no real VBlank isr because 
the switchboard already takes care of acknowledging the interrupt.
After that it's pretty simple: we use 
<code>ObjAffineSet()</code> to calculate the required affine matrix 
and <code>VBlankIntrWait</code> puts the CPU on Halt until the next 
VBlank interrupt.

<div class="nhgood">Prefer VBlankIntrWait() over vid_vsync()</div>
<p>
Waiting for the VBlank via <code>vid_vsync()</code> (or its 
functional equivalent) is not a good idea: it wastes too much battery 
power. The recommended procedure is using <code>VBlankIntrWait()</code> 
to halt the processor, to be woken again on the VBlank interrupt.
</p>
</div>


<div class="note">
<div class="nhcare">Acknowledging IntrWait routines</div>
<p>
<code>VBlankIntrWait()</code> is only one of the BIOS's 
<code>IntrWait()</code> routines that can stop the CPU until an 
interrupt has been raised. However, it doesn't look at 
<code>REG_IF</code> but at <code>REG_IFBIOS</code> (0300:7FF8) for the 
acknowledgement of the interrupt. If your game locks up after trying 
<code>VBlankIntrWait()</code>, this may be why. Note that you may 
find the address under other names, as there isn't really an official 
one for it.

  Final thoughts</h2>
<p>
Now that you know how to use them, I should warn you that you shouldn't 
go overboard with them. It appears that the BIOS routines have been 
designed for space, not speed, so they aren't the fastest in the world. 
Not only that, there's an overhead of at least 60 cycles for each one 
(mind you, normal functions seem to have a 30 cycle overhead). 
If speed is what you're after then the BIOS calls may not be the best 
thing; you can probably find faster routines on the web ... somewhere. 
This doesn't mean that the BIOS routines can't be useful, of course, 
but if you have alternative methods, use those instead. Just remember 
that that's an optimisation step, which you shouldn't do prematurely.
