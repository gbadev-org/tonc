  Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this chapter, we'll look at the bitmap modes. Bitmap modes are a 
good place to start because there is a one to one relation between 
the contents of memory and the pixels on the screen. The essentials 
of all the bitmap modes will be discussed briefly, with a closer look 
at what you can do in mode 3 as an example. We'll also see a bit of 
page flipping (mode 4), which allows for smoother animation.
</p>
<p>
The chapter will close with a section on how to deal with data and 
computer memory in general. Because GBA programming is very close to 
the hardware, you <i>need</i> to know these things. If you've been 
programming (in C or assembly) for a long time and have already gained 
a good understanding on data, datatypes and memory you can probably 
skip it; for the rest of you, I would strongly urge to read it, 
because it is very important for all the chapters to come. 
</p>

  <b>Fig 5.1</b>: Link (24x24 bitmap).
</div>

<p>
In fig&nbsp;5.1 you can find a bitmap of one of 
the game characters that made Nintendo great. This is probably how 
most people think of bitmaps: a grid of colored pixels. In order to 
use bitmaps in a program we need to know how they're arranged in 
memory. For that we use fig&nbsp;5.2 (below); 
this is a zoomed out version of fig&nbsp;5.1, 
with a pixel grid imposed over it and some numbers.
<p>
A bitmap is little more than a <i>w</i>&times;<i>h</i> matrix of colors 
(or color-indices), where <i>w</i> is the number of columns (the width) 
and <i>h</i> the number of rows (the height).
A particular pixel can be referred to with a coordinate pair:
(<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>). By the way, the y-axis of the GBA points 
<i>down</i>, not up. So pixel (0,&nbsp;0) is in the top-left
corner. In memory, the lines of the bitmap are laid out sequentially, 
so that the following rule holds: in a <i>w&times;h</i> bitmap,
the pixel (<i>x,&nbsp;y</i>) is the 
(<i>w&times;y&nbsp;+&nbsp;x</i>)-th pixel. This is true for all C 
matrices, by the way.

<!--
Remember that in C you can have two dimensional matrices,
which are basically arrays of arrays, so that the following rule holds:
</p>


<pre class="proglist">
<span class="keyw">int</span> mat[h][w];    <span 
  class="cmt">// matrix, w wide, h height</span>
<span class="keyw">int</span> *arr= &amp;mat;   <span
class="cmt">// matrix in array form</span>

mat[ix][iy]= color;       <span class="cmt">// pixel(ix, iy) = color</span>
arr[ix + w*iy]= color;    <span class="cmt">// ditto</span>
</pre>
-->
<p>
Fig 5.2 shows how this works. This is a 
<i>w</i>=24 by <i>h</i>=24 bitmap, at 8bpp (8 <u>B</u>its 
<u>P</u>er <u>P</u>ixel (=1 byte)). The numbers in yellow indicate 
the memory locations; you can count them for yourself if you don't 
believe me. The first pixel, (0,&nbsp;0), can be found at location 0. 
The <i>last</i> pixel of the <i>first</i> row (23,&nbsp;0) is at 
<i>w</i>&minus;1 (=23 in this case). The first pixel of the second 
row (0,&nbsp;1) is at <i>w</i> (=24) etc, etc, till 
the last pixel at <i>w&times;h</i>&minus;1. 
</p>

<table id="img-link-big">

Note, however, that when you use another bitdepth, the addresses change 
too. For example, at 16bpp (2 bytes per pixel), you'd
need to multiply the pixel-number by 2. Or use another datatype for 
your array. The general formula is left as an exercise for the reader.

<p>
Usually it's not actually the width (i.e., the number of pixels in a 
row) that's important, but the <dfn>pitch</dfn>. The pitch is defined 
as the number of bytes in a scanline. For 8bpp images the pitch and 
width will usually be the same, but for, say, 16bpp images (2 bytes 
per pixel) the pitch is the width times two. There's another catch: 
memory alignment. Alignment will be covered in 
a <a href="#ssec-data-align">later section</a>, but the upshot is that
systems generally have a &lsquo;preferred&rsquo; type size and can 
better deal with data if the addresses are a multiple of that 
type size. This is why windows BMPs' scanlines are always aligned to 
32bit boundaries. 
</p>

<h2 id="sec-modes">5.2.
  The GBA bitmap modes</h2>
<p>
Video modes 3, 4 and 5 are the bitmap modes. To use them, put 3, 4
or 5 in the lowest bits of 
<a href="video.htm#tbl-reg-dispcnt">REG_DISPCNT</a> and 
enable <code>BG2</code>. You may wonder why we start with mode 3, 
rather than mode 0. The reason for this is that bitmaps are a lot 
easier to come to terms with than tilemaps. And this is the 
<i>only</i> reason. The truth of the matter is that the bitmap 
modes are just too slow to be used for most conventional GBA games. 
I can't give an exact figure, but if someone told me 90% or more 
of GBA games used tilemodes and not bitmap modes, I wouldn't be 
surprised. The only time when bitmap modes would be beneficial 
would be either for very static screens (introductory demos) or 
very dynamic screens (3D games like Starfox or Doom).
</p>
<p>
The bitmap modes have the following characteristics:
</p>

<div class="lblock">
<table id="tbl-bm-types"
  border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<caption align="bottom">
  <b>Table 5.1</b>: Bitmap mode 
  characteristics
</caption>
<tr>
  <th>mode<th>width<th>height<th>bpp<th>size     <th>page-flip
<tr>
  <td>3   <td>240  <td>160   <td>16 <td>1x 12C00h <td>No
<tr>
  <td>4   <td>240  <td>160   <td>8  <td>2x 9600h <td>Yes
<tr>
  <td>5   <td>160  <td>128   <td>16 <td>2x A000h <td>Yes
</table>
</div>

<p>
What width, height and bpp mean should be clear by now; the size
that the bitmap requires is simply <i>width &times; height
&times; bpp/8</i>. Page flipping may need some more explanation, 
but first we'll look at some examples of mode 3 graphics.
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-modes-m3">5.2.1.
  Drawing primitives in mode 3</h3>
<p>
We've already seen how to plot pixels, now it's time for some lines 
and rectangles. Horizontal lines are piss-easy: because the pixels 
are in adjacent memory, all you need is a simple loop from the 
starting <i>x</i> to the final <i>x</i>. Vertical lines are 
nearly as easy: while the pixels aren't right next to each other, 
they do have a fixed offset between them, namely the pitch. So again
a simple loop is all you need. Rectangles are essentially multiple 
horizontal lines, so those are easy as well.
</p>
<p>
Diagonal lines are a little trickier, for a number of reasons. 
Diagonal lines have a slope that indicates how many horizontal steps 
you need to take before moving to the next scanline. That would only 
work if the absolute value were lower than one, otherwise you'd get 
gaps between pixels. For higher slopes, you need to increment 
vertically, and plot horizontally.
</p>
<p>
Another point is how to make the 
routine fast enough to be of real use. Fortunately, these things 
have all been figured out in the past already, so we'll just use the 
results here. In this case, we'll use a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm" target="_blank">Bresenham 
Midpoint</a> algorithm for the line drawing, modified to deal with 
horizontal and vertical lines separately. While I could explain what 
the routine does exactly, it is out of the scope of the chapter, 
really.
</p>
<p>
Two points I have ignored here are normalization and clipping. 
<dfn>Normalization</dfn> means making sure the routine runs in the 
right direction. For example, when implementing a line drawing 
routine that runs from <code>x1</code> to <code>x2</code> via an 
incrementing for loop, you'd best be sure that <code>x2</code> is 
actually higher than <code>x1</code> in the first place. 
<dfn>Clipping</dfn> means cutting the primitive down to fit inside 
the viewport. While this is a good thing to do, we will omit it 
because it can get really hairy to do it well.
</p><br>

<p>
The code below is an excerpt from <tt>toolbox.c</tt> from the 
<tt>m3_demo</tt> and contains functions for drawing lines, rectangles 
and frames on a 16bpp canvas, like in mode 3 and mode 5. 
<code>dstBase</code> is the base-pointer to the canvas and 
<code>dstPitch</code> is the pitch. The rest of the parameters should be 
obvious.

has 16bit colors. That said, it may be annoying to have to add the 
canvas pointer and pitch all the time, so you could create an

The ones for mode 3 would look something like this:

<p>
Now, note what I'm doing here: instead of treating VRAM as an 
array of 16bit values which are appropriate for 16bpp colors, 
I'm using a 32bit pointer and filling VRAM with a 32bit variable 
containing two colors.
When filling large chunks of memory, it makes no difference if I fill 
it in <i>N</i> 16bit chunks, or &frac12;<i>N</i> 32bit chunks. 
However, because you only use half the number of iterations in the 
latter case, it's roughly twice as fast. In C, it's perfectly 
legal to do something like this and often actually useful. 
This is why it's important to know the principles of 
<a href="#sec-data">data and memory</a>. Also note that I'm using
pointer arithmetic here instead of array indices. While the compiler 
generally make the conversion itself, doing it manually is still often 
a little faster.
</p>
<p>
While this method is already twice as fast as the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; 
method, there are actually much faster methods as well. We will meet 
these later, when we stop using separate <tt>toolkit</tt> files 
and start using <tt>tonclib</tt>, the code library for tonc. Tonclib 
contains the functions described above (only faster), as well 
as 8bpp variations of the <code>bmp16_</code> routines and interfaces 
for mode 4 and mode 5.
</p><br>

<p>
Below you can find the main code for <tt>m3_demo</tt>, which uses 
the <code>m3_</code> functions to draw some items on the screen. 
Technically, it's bad form to use this many magic numbers, but 
for demonstration purposes it should be okay. The result can be seen 
in fig&nbsp;5.3.

<h3 id="ssec-modes-m4">A dash of mode 4</h3>
<p>
Mode 4 is another bitmap mode. It also has a 240&times;160 
frame-buffer, but instead of 16bpp pixels it uses 8bpp pixels. These 
8 bits are a <dfn>palette index</dfn> to the background palette 
located at <code>0500:0000</code>. The color you'll see on screen 
is the color found in the palette at that location. 
</p>
<p>
Pixels of a bitdepth of 8 mean you can only have 256 colors at a time 
(instead of 32678 in the case of 15bpp), but there are benefits as 
well. For one, you can manipulate the colors of many pixels by simply 
changing the color in the palette. An 8bpp frame-buffer also takes up 
half as much memory as a 16bpp buffer. Not only is it faster to fill 
(well, in principle anyway), but there is now also room for a second 
buffer to allow <a href="#sec-page">page flipping</a>. Why that's 
useful will be covered in a minute.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, one major downsize to using mode 4, which stems 
from a hardware limitation. With 8bit pixels, it'd make sense to 
map VRAM as an array of bytes. This would be fine if it weren't for 
the rather annoying fact that VRAM does not allow 
byte-writes! Now, because this is a very important point, let 
me repeat that: <b><span class="rem">You cannot write to VRAM in 
byte-sized chunks!!!</span></b>. Byte-reads are ok, but writes have 
to be done in 16-bit or 32-bit bit chunks. If you <i>do</i> write 
in bytes to VRAM, the halfword you're accessing will end up with that 
byte in both its bytes: you're setting two pixels at once. 
Note that this no-byte-write rule also extends to PALRAM and OAM, 
but there it doesn't cause trouble because you won't be using that 
as bytes anyway.
</p>

<p>
So how to plot single-pixels then? Well, you have to read the whole 
halfword you're trying to access, mask off the bits you don't want to 
overwrite, insert your pixels and then write it back. In code:
</p>


<pre class="proglist">

class="cmt">// even pixel</span>
}
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, it's a little more complicated than 
<code>m3_plot()</code>. It takes a lot longer to run as well.
Still, once you have a pixel plotter, you can create other rendering 
routines with ease. The basic code for drawing lines, rectangles, 
circles and the like are pretty much independent of how pixels are 
formatted. For example, drawing a rectangle is basically plotting 
pixels in a double loop.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="keyw">void</span> generic_rect(<span 
class="keyw">int</span> left, <span class="keyw">int</span> top, <span 
class="keyw">int</span> right, <span class="keyw">int</span> bottom, COLOR clr)
{
    <span class="keyw">int</span> ix, iy;
    <span class="keyw">for</span>(iy=top; iy&lt;bottom; iy++)
        <span class="keyw">for</span>(ix=left; ix&lt;right; ix++)
            generic_plot(ix, iy, clr);
}
</pre>

<p>
This is the generic template for a rectangle drawing routine. As long
as you have a functional pixel plotter, you're in business. However, 
business will be <i>very</i> slow in mode 4, because of the complicated 
form of the plotter. In all likelihood, it'll be so slow to make it 
useless for games. There is a way out, though. The reason 
<code>m4_plot()</code> is slow is because you have to take care not to 
overwrite the other pixel. However, when you're drawing a horizontal 
line (basically the <code>ix</code> loop here), chances are that you'll 
have to give that other pixel the same color anyway, so you needn't 
bother with read-mask-write stuff except at the edges. The 
implementation of this faster (<i>much</i> faster) line algorithm 
and subsequently rectangle drawer is left as an exercise for the 
reader. Or you can seek out <tt>tonc_bmp8.c</tt> in tonclib.
</p>

<div class="note">
<div class="nhcare">VRAM vs byte writes</div>
<p>
You cannot write individual bytes into VRAM (or PALRAM or OAM for 
that matter). Halfwords or words only, please. If you want to 
write single bytes, you have to read the full (half)word, insert 
the byte, and put it back.
</p><br>
<p>
Please don't skip this note, and make yourself aware of the full 
ramifications of this. Errors due to pointer-type mismatches are 
very easy to make, and <a href="#ssec-data-memcpy">you may be writing 
to VRAM as bytes more often than you think</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<div class="nhcare">Generic vs specific rendering routines</div>
<p>
Every kind of graphics surface needs its own pixel plottet.
In principle, more complicated (multi-pixel) shapes are surface 
independent. For example, a line routine follows the same
algorithm, but simply uses a different plotter for drawing pixels. 
These generic forms are great in terms of re-usability and
maintainability, but can be <i>disastrous</i> when it comes to 
speed. Creating surface-specific renderers may be extra work, 
but can on occasion save you up to a factor 100 in speed.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ssec-modes-details">5.2.3.
  Complications of bitmap modes</h3>
<p>
While I could go on to discuss more complicated matters, such as 
drawing rectangles and blits and text, there's very little reason to 
do so at this junction. As I said before, the bitmap modes are
useful to learn some basic functionality, but for most practical
purposes, you're better off with tiled modes. 
</p>
<p>
The primary issue is speed. Even simple primitives 
such as the ones shown here can take a lot of time, especially 
if you're not careful in your implementation. For example, a full 
mode 3 screen-wipe would take about 60% of a VBlank <b>at best</b>! 
In bad implementations of a screen-wipe, 
like doing it with a rectangle drawer that calls a non-inline 
pixel-plotting function, could take as much as 10 frames. And 
<i>then</i> you still have to draw all your backgrounds and 
sprites and do the game logic. The phrase &lsquo;crawling horror&rsquo; 
somehow springs to mind at the thought of this.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, bitmap modes can use only one background and have no 
hardware scrolling to speak of. Also, though this is jumping the
gun a bit, it overlaps the memory that contains the sprite
<a href="objbg.htm#sec-img"> tiles</a>, 
which starts at <code>0601:0000h</code>. For that reason, you will 
only be able to use sprite-tiles 512 to 1023 when in modes 3-5.
</p>
<p>
Page flipping can alleviate some of these items, but that's not 
available in mode 3. It is in mode 5, but that uses only a small 
portion of the screen, so gaming with only that looks awkward.
As for mode 4, well, that's one of those places where you will
<i>really</i> see what programming close to the hardware means: 
it doesn't allow you to write to VRAM in byte-sized chunks! 
The only way to have a single-pixel resolution is to combine 2 
adjacent pixels and write those, which costs a lot of extra time.
</p>
<p>
So basically, use the bitmap modes for testing and/or static images, 
but not much else unless you know the tilemodes can't do what you 
want.
</p>


<div class="note">
<div class="nhbad">Bitmap modes are not for gaming</div>
<p>
Do not get too comfortable with bitmap modes. They're nice for 
gbadev introductory sections because they are easier to work with 
than tile modes, they are <i>not</i> suitable for most types of 
games because the GBA simply can't push pixels fast enough. 
Tinker with them to get a feel for IO registers and the like, 
then move on.

  Page flipping</h2>

<div class="cpt_fr" style="width:216px;">
  <img src="../img/bitmaps/pageflip.png" id="img-flip" 
    alt="Page flipping procedure"><br>
  <b>Fig 5.4</b>: Page flipping procedure. 
  No data is copied, only the &lsquo;display&rsquo; and 
  &lsquo;write&rsquo; pointers are swapped.
</div>

<p>
Page flipping is a technique that eliminates nasty artifacts
like tearing in animation. There are two things going on at the same 
time in an animation: placing the pixels on bitmap (writing), and
drawing the bitmap on screen (displaying). Software takes care of 
writing, updating the positions of characters etc; hardware does the 
displaying: it simply takes the bitmap and copies it to the screen. The 
problem is that both these processes take time. What's worse, they 
happen at the same time. And when the game state changes in mid draw, 
the bottom section will be of the current state, while the top section 
will represent the previous state. Needless to say, this is bad.
</p>
<p>
Enter page flipping. Instead of using one single bitmap to write 
and display, you use two. While one bitmap is displayed, you write 
all you need onto a second bitmap (the back-buffer). Then, when you're 
finished, you tell the hardware to display that second bitmap and you
can prepare the next frame on the first. No artifacts whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
While the procedure works great, there are some snares. For the 
first, consider this. Given are the pointers to the two pages 
<code>page1</code> and <code>page2</code>. Right now, 
<code>page1</code> is displayed and
<code>page2</code> is being prepared; so far so good. But when you 
switch to the second page, this only makes <code>page2</code> the 
display-page; you have to make <code>page1</code> the write-page 
yourself! The solution to this problem is simple: use a write-buffer 
pointer, but it can catch you off-guard if you're new to this stuff.
</p>
<p>
The second problem concerns a little nasty in the age-old method of 
animation. The canonical animation does this. Frame1: draw object. 
Frame2: erase old object, draw object in new state. This doesn't work 
for page flipping since Frame2 is written on an entirely different 
bitmap than Frame1, so trying to erase Frame1's old object doesn't. 
What you need to erase is the object from 2 frames ago. Again, easy 
solution, but you have be aware of the problem. (Of course, erasing 
the entire frame each time would work too, but who's got the time?)
</p>

<div class="note">
<div class="nhgood">Pageflipping, not double buffering</div>
<p>
Another method of smoother animation is double buffering: draw on 
a secondary buffer (the backbuffer) and copy it to the screen when 
finished. This is a fundamentally different technique than page 
flipping! Even though both use two buffers, in page flipping you 
don't copy the backbuffer to the display buffer, you <i>make</i> 
backbuffer the display buffer.
</p>
<p>
What the GBA does is page flipping, so refer to it as such.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ssec-page-gba">5.3.1.
  GBA page flipping</h3>
<p>
The second page of the GBA is located at location <code>0600:A000h</code>.
If you look at the size required for mode 3, you'll see why it doesn't
have page-flipping capabilities: there's no room for a second page. To set 
the GBA to display the second page, set 
<a href="video.htm#tbl-reg-dispcnt"><code>REG_DISPCNT</code></a>{4}. 
My page flipping function looks a little like this:
</p>

<pre class="proglist" id="cd-vid-flip">
u16 *vid_flip()
{
    <span class="cmt">// toggle the write_buffer's page</span>
    vid_page= (u16*)((u32)vid_page ^ VID_FLIP);
    REG_DISPCNT ^= DCNT_PAGE;            <span 
class="cmt">// update control register</span>
    <span class="keyw">return</span> vid_page;
}
</pre>

<p>
The code is relatively straightforward. <code>vid_page</code> is the
pointer that always points to the write-page. I had to pull a little 
casting trickery to get the <code>XOR</code> to work (C doesn't like it 
when you try it on pointers). On the GBA, the steps for page flipping 
are perfectly xorrable operations. Sure, you <i>could</i> just put the 
equivalent in an <code>if-else</code> block, but where's the fun in 
that <tt>:P</tt>?
</p>


<h3 id="ssec-page-demo">5.3.2.
  Page flipping demo</h3>
<p>
What follows is the code (sans data) for the <tt>pageflip</tt> demo. 
The actual part concerned with page flipping is very small. In 
fact, the actual flip is merely a call to <code>vid_flip()</code> 
once every 60 frames = 1 second (point 3). We'll also have to set the 
video mode to something that actually has pages to flip, which in this 
case is mode 4.
</p>
<p>
What we'll have to do as well is load the data that will be displayed 
on these two pages. I'm using the standard C routine 
<code>memcpy()</code> for the copy, because that's the standard way of 
copying things in C. While it's faster than manual loops, it does come 
with a <a href="#ssec-data-memcpy">few snares</a> that you need to 
be aware of before using it everywhere. Tonclib comes with faster 
and safer routines, but we'll get to those when it's time.
</p>
<p>
Loading a bitmap is very simple in theory, but the bitmap(s) 
I'm using are only 144x16 in size, while the VRAM page's pitch is 240 
pixels wide. This means that we'll have to copy each scanline 
separately, which is done at point (1). Note that I'm copying 
<code>frontBitmap</code> to <code>vid_mem_front</code> and 
<code>backBitmap</code> to <code>vid_mem_back</code>, because those 
are the starting locations of the two pages. 
</p>
<p>
Since these are mode 4 bitmaps, they'll also need a palette. Both 
palettes use <code>frontPal</code>, but instead of using 
<code>memcpy()</code> to copy it to the background palette memory, 
I'm using a u32-array because &hellip; well, just because I guess.
</p>
<p>

<h2 id="sec-data">5.4.
  On data and how to use it</h2>
<p>
This section is a little boring (ok, very boring) but it needs to 
be said. While books and tutorials on C may use data for whatever 
purpose, they often gloss over what data actually <i>is</i> at the 
lowest level, and how to deal with it correctly. As you'll be dealing 
directly with hardware and memory here, it is important that you 
are aware of these items, preferably even understand them, so that 
they don't bite you in the ass at some later point.
</p>
<p>
The first two subsections are about how to get graphics into your 
game, something that you'll really need to know. After that I'll 
discuss a few nasty and highly technical things that may or may not 
cause problems later on. These are optional and you can 
skip to the <a href="#ssec-data-demo">data-loading/interpreting demo</a> 
at any time. That said, I urge you to read them anyway because they 
may save you a lot of debugging time.
</p>

<div class="note">
<div class="nhgood">Relax, it's only 1s and 0s</div>
<p>
When you get right down to it, everything on computers is merely a 
big mess of bits without any purpose by itself. It is the 
interaction between hardware and software that makes sequences of 
bits appear as valid executable code, a bitmap, music or whatever.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ssec-data-files">5.4.1.
  Yes, we have no files</h3>
<p>
This may be a good point to say a few words on data. 
Strictly speaking, <i>everything</i> is data, but in this case I'm 
referring to data that on PC games would be separate
from the executable: graphics, music, maybe scripts and text-files 
and what not. This all works fine on a PC, but not so fine on the 
GBA because there <i>is no file system</i>. This means that you 
cannot use the standard file I/O routines (<code>fscanf()</code>,
<code>fread()</code>, etc) to read the data, because there are no 
files to read them from.
</p>
<p>
All the game's data has to be added directly to the binary. There are 
a number of ways to do this. The most common way is to convert the 
raw binary files to C-arrays, then compile those and link them to the 
project. Well, the most common among homebrewers is probably 
converting to C-arrays and #including them, but that's something 
that you should <i>never</i> do. Also popular are assembly arrays. 
These are a useful alternative to C arrays because a) they 
<i>can't</i> be #included and b) because they bypass the compilation 
step and compilation of arrays is very intensive. Of course, you would  
have to know how to work with the assembler. Another nice thing about 
the assembler is that you can include binary files directly into them,
eliminating the need for a converter. Lastly, while the GBA doesn't 
have a native file system, you can always write your own. A common 
one is <a href="http://www.pineight.com/gba/#gbfs" target="_blank">GBFS</a> by 
the gbadev forum FAQ maintainer, tepples. Using a file system is
actually the recommended method, but for now, I'll stick to
C-arrays because they are the easiest to use.
</p><br>

<div class="note">
<div class="nh">Ahem. Actually, we <i>do</i> have files</div>
<p>
There <i>were</i> no files in the past, but in July of 2006,
<a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/" target="_blank">Chishm</a> gave us 
<tt>libfat</tt>, which is a FAT-like file system for GBA and NDS.
It is distributed via DKP as well, so chances are you have it already.
</p>
</div>

<h4>Where do my arrays go?</h4>
<p>
By default, arrays go into IWRAM. You know, the one that's only 32 kb
long. Now, a mode 3 bitmap is 240x160x2 = 77 kb. Obviously,  
trying to put a 77 kb object into a 32kb section would fit nicely
into the bad things category. To avoid this, put it in the read-only 
section (ROM), which is much larger. All you have to do for this is 
add the &lsquo;<code>const</code>&rsquo; keyword to the definition 
if you're using C, or the &lsquo;<code>.rodata</code>&rsquo; 
directive in assembly. Note that for multiboot programs ROM actually 
means EWRAM, which is only 256 kb long. The latter would fit three 
mode 3 bitmaps; more would again be bad unless you use compression.
</p>
<p>
Note that what I said about arrays is true for <i>all</i> arrays, 
not just data arrays: if you want any kind of large array (like a 
backbuffer for mode 3), it would also default to and <i>kill</i> 
IWRAM. But you can't make it const because then you'd not be able to 
write on it. GCC has attributes that lets you choose where things are 
put &ndash; in EWRAM for instance. Here are the commonly seen #defines 
for the attributes that can be used for specific section placement.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="keyw">#define</span> EWRAM_DATA <!--

<h4>Converted and const arrays in C++</h4>
<p>
There are two little snags that you can trip on if you're using 
(converted) data arrays in C++. The first is that tools that generate 
the arrays will output C-files, not C++-files. This is not a problem 
in itself because those files will be compiled just the same. What 
<i>is</i> a problem is that C++ uses something known as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling" target="_blank">Name mangling</a> 
to allow overloading and stuff like that. C doesn't and as a result, 
the name that the C++ file looks for isn't the same one as in the 
C file and you get undefined references. To fix this, use 
`<code>extern "C"</code>' in front or around the declarations of the 
stuff in the C files.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="cmt">// This:</span>

<span class="keyw">extern</span> <span class="str">"C"</span> <span 
class="keyw">const unsigned char</span> C_array[];

<span class="cmt">// Or this:</span>
<span class="keyw">extern</span> <span class="str">"C"</span>
{
<span class="keyw">const unsigned char</span> C_array1[];
<span class="keyw">const unsigned char</span> C_array2[];
}
</pre>

<p>
Another problem with C++ is that const-arrays are considered static 
(local to the file that contains it) unless you add an external 
declaration to it. So if you just have 
`<code>const u8 foo[]= { etc }</code>' in a file, the array will be 
invisible to other files.The solution here would be to add the 
declaration inside the file itself as well.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="cmt">// foo.cpp. Always have an external declaration 
// inside the file as well.</span>

<span class="keyw">extern const unsigned char</span> foo[];

<span class="keyw">const unsigned char</span> foo[]=
{
    <span class="cmt">// data</span>
};
</pre>

  Data conversion</h3>
<p>
It's rather easy to write a tool that converts a binary file to 
a C or asm array. In fact, devkitARM comes with two that do just 
that: <tt>raw2c.exe</tt> and <tt>bin2s.exe</tt>. It also comes 
with the basic tools for gbfs by the way. But being able to attach
binary files to your game is only part of the story. Consider a
bitmap, for example. In principle, a bitmap is a binary file just 
like any other. There's nothing inherently graphical about it, 
and it doesn't magically appear as a bitmap whenever you use it by 
itself. Yes, when you double-click on it, an image viewer may pop 
up and display it, but that's only because there's some serious work 
by the OS going on underneath. Which we don't have here.
</p>
<p>
Most files will follow a certain format to tell it what it is, 
and how to use it. For bitmaps, that usually means width, height, 
bitdepths and a few other fields as well. The point is that they're 
not directly usable. You can't just attach, say, a BMP file to your 
project and copy it to VRAM and think that everything will work 
out. No, you have to <i>convert</i> it to a GBA-usable format. 
Now, you can do this internally (on the GBA itself), or externally 
(on the PC and attach the converted data to the project). Because 
the latter is a much more efficient use of GBA resources, that is 
the usual procedure.
</p>
<p>
There are many conversion tools, one might almost say too many. Some 
are one-trick ponies: a single file-type to a single graphics mode 
for example. Some are very powerful and can handle multiple file-types, 
multiple files, different conversion modes with lots of options on the 
side, and compression. It should be obvious which are of the most value.
</p>
<p>
A good one is <a href="http://www.coranac.com/files/gba/gfx2gba.zip" target="_blank">gfx2gba</a>. 
This is a command-line tool so that it can be used in a makefile, but 
there is a GUI front-end for it as well. This tool has the Good Things 
I mentioned earlier, plus some map-exporting options and palette 
merging, but the input file must be 8bit and I hear that while it does 
compress data, the array-size is still given as its uncompressed size 
for some unfortunate reason. This tool comes with the HAM 
installation, and is quite common, so definitely recommended. 
Unfortunately, there seems to be another tool with the same name. 
You'll want the v0.13 version by Markus, not the other one.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I use 
<a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/#usenti" target="_blank">Usenti</a>, 
but then I pretty much have to because its my own tool. This is actually 
a bitmap editor with exporting options thrown in. It allows different 
file-types, different bitdepths, different output files, all modes, 
some map-exporting stuff, meta-tiling, compression and a few others. 
It may not be as powerful as big photo-editing tools as PhotoShop, 
Gimp and the like, but it gets the job done. If you're still drawing 
your graphics with MS-Paint, please stop that and use this one instead. 
The exporter is also available separately in the form of the open source 
project called 
<a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/#grit" target="_blank">(win)grit</a>, 
which comes in a command-line interface (grit) and a GUI (wingrit). 
As of January 2007, it is also part of the devkitPro distribution.

There are many command-line interfaces available for graphics

Below, you can see a partial listing of <tt>modes.c</tt>, which 
contains the bitmap and the palette used in the <tt>bm_modes</tt> demo
discussed at the end of this section, 
as exported by Usenti. It is only a very small part of the file because 
at over 2700 lines it is way too long to display here, which wouldn't 
serve much of a purpose anyway. Note that both are u32-arrays, rather 
than the u8 or u16-arrays you might encounter elsewhere. What you need 
to remember is that <b>it doesn't matter</b> in what kind of an array 
you put the data: in memory it'll come out the same anyway. 
</p>
<p>
Well, that's not <i>quite</i> true. Only with u32-arrays is proper 
<a href="#ssec-data-align">data alignment</a> guaranteed, which is 
a good thing. More importantly, you have to be careful with the 
byte-order of multi-byte types. This is called the <a 
href="numbers.htm#ssec-bits-endian">endianness</a> of types. In 
a <dfn>little endian</dfn> scheme, least significant bytes will go 
first and in a <dfn>big endian</dfn>, most significant bytes will go 
first. See table 2 for an example using <code>0x01</code>, 
<code>0x02</code>, <code>0x03</code> and <code>0x04</code>. The GBA 
is a little endian machine, so the first word of the 
<code>modesBitmap</code> array, <code>0x7FE003E0</code> is the 
halfwords <code>0x03E0</code> (green) followed by <code>0x7FE0</code> 
(cyan). If you want more examples of this, open up VBA's memory 
viewer and play around with the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit settings.
</p>
<p>
The key point here: the data itself doesn't change when you use 
different data-types for the arrays, only the way you <i>represent</i> 
it does. That was also the point of the <tt>bm_modes</tt> demo: 
it's the same data in VRAM all the time; it's just used in a 
different way.

Those 2700 lines represent a 77kb bitmap. One <i>single</i> bitmap. In 
all likelihood, you'll need at least a couple of them to make anything 
worthwhile. Most games have lots of data in them, not only graphics 
but maps and sound and music as well. All this adds up to a huge amount 
of data, certainly too much for just EWRAM and maybe even for a full 
cart. That is why <dfn>compression</dfn> is also important. The 
<a href="swi.htm">GBA BIOS</a> has decompression routines for 
bit-packing, run-length encoding, LZ77 and Huffman. Converters 
sometimes have the appropriate compressors for these routines, 
which can drastically shrink the amount of memory used. Usenti and 
(win)grit support these compressors. So does gfx2gba, which even has 
some more. A tool that just does compression on binary files (but does 
it very well) is <a 
href="http://www.coranac.com/files/gba/GBACrusher.zip" target="_blank">GBACrusher</a>. 
I won't go into compression that much (or at all), but you can read up 
on the subject 
<a href="http://members.iinet.net.au/~freeaxs/gbacomp/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<div class="note">
<div class="nhgood">Understanding data</div>
<p>
It is vital that you understand what data is, how the different 
datatypes work. Preferably endianness and alignment too. Emulators and 
hex editors can help you with this. Once you have compilation working, 
just make a few random arrays and see what they look like in the VBA 
memory viewer for a while.

<p>
Most non-trivial projects will have multiple files with code and data.
The standard way of dealing with these is to compile these separately 
and then link the results to the final binary. This is the recommended 
strategy.
However, most other tutorials and many of the example code you can find
on the web do something else: they #include everything into the main 
source file and compile that. This is <i>not</i> a recommended practice 
and should be avoided.
</p>
<p>
&rdquo;But why not? It seems to work fine, and it's so easy!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Yes, it is easy; and it does seem to work. The main problem is that
it isn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability" target="_blank">scalable</a>.
For small projects (a handful of files) you probably won't notice, 
but as projects grow to hundreds and perhaps thousands of files, 
you will run into some very annoying problems.

The main issue is what #include actually does. It copies the whole 
included file into the includer to form a single larger file. This 
leads to the following issues.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Massive files to compile</b>. So, #including creates one big file.
    If you have a lot of stuff, you'll have one <i>very</i> big 
	file. This will cost large amounts of memory and slows down
	compilation. As the project grows, what starts as a compile time of 
	a second can grow to several, then minutes and perhaps even hours. 

	</p>
	<p>
	At some point, there was also the problem that the compiler couldn't
	handle files exceeding 4MB, putting a limit on how much you 
	could #include in a C file. I'm not sure if this is still an issue.
	</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Recompiling the world</b>. The main problem is that when you #include 
	everything, you need to recompile everything as well. If you make one 
	change <i>anywhere</i>, no matter how small, causes	<i>everything</i> 
	to be compiled. For small projects (say, a handful of files), a full 
	rebuild would take a few seconds so it's not a problem. But larger 
	projects can have hundreds or thousands of files, and the time is not
	measured in seconds, but in minutes or perhaps hours.
	Sure it's a good excuse to go <a href="http://xkcd.com/303/" target="_blank">sword
	fighting</a>, but terribly annoying if you want to do something
	productive.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Bloat</b>. Even if your own code and data are relatively small in
    number, you're probably using some code library for API functions. 
    Normally, these are pre-compiled and only the functions used are 
	linked into your binary. But if those worked by #include as well 
	(in other words, if their creators had followed the practice I'm 
	warning against), every function in that library would be included
	as well, including the ones you're not using. This increases the filesize,
	<i>and</i> increases the problems mentioned above.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Undeclared identifiers, multiple	definitions and circular 
	dependencies</b>. In a nutshell, C requires that you declare an
	identifier before it's referenced, and it can only be defined once.
	The first point means that the order of inclusions starts to matter:
	if, say, <tt>fileB.c</tt> needs something from <tt>fileA.c</tt>, the
	latter needs to be included before the former to get a compile. The
	second means that you could only #include a file once in the whole
	project: if <tt>fileB.c</tt> and <tt>fileC.c</tt> both need stuff 
	from <tt>fileA.c</tt>, you can't #include it in them both because 
	when they're #included in <tt>main.c</tt>, <tt>fileA.c</tt> is 
	effectively #included twice and the compiler will balk.
	</p>
	<p>
	These points can technically be overcome by being careful. But, 
	again, when projects grow, things can get increasingly more 
	difficult to keep track of which comes before what and why. There 
	is, however, one point at which it <i>will</i> go wrong, namely 
	when there are circular dependencies: <tt>fileB.c</tt> needs 
	<tt>fileA.c</tt> and vice versa. Each file would require the 
	other to go first, which simply isn't possible because it'd cause 
	multiple definitions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Data alignment</b>. I'll get to what this means in a minute, but
    right now know that copy routines work better if the data is
    aligned to 32-bit boundaries (even for byte and halfword arrays).
	Some of them won't even work properly if this isn't the case.
	This is usually guaranteed if you compile separately, but if the
	arrays are #included and no steps have been taken to force alignment,
	you simply never know.
	</p>
	<p>
	It's not much of a problem nowadays because most graphics converters
	force data-alignment, but you still need to know about it. Because
	data alignment is a fairly esotheric concept, it's next to impossible 
	to track down unless you're aware of the problems it can bring.
	</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
So please, do yourself a favor and do not #include every file you have 
into <tt>main.c</tt> or its moral equivalent. Put function and variable
definitions in separate source files to be compiled separately and 
linked later. The #include directive is only to be used for files 
with preprocessor directives and declaractions and type definitions.
Oh, and inline functions. Those are okay there too.
</p>

<!--
<hr>

<p>
Most other tutorials and a lot of demo code attach the converted data 
by #including file with the data into the main source file. This is
a bad practice, and should not be followed.
</p>
<p>
&rdquo;Why not? It seems to work fine, and it's so easy!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Yes, it is easy, it does seem to work (for small projects anyway), 
and everybody else seems to use it. However, it is still very, very 
wrong. Please resist the temptation to include files with data and 
code, and compile and link them separately as Kernighan and Ritchie
intended. Here are a few reasons why.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>Massive files to compile</b>. 
  The <code>#include</code> directive includes the whole of a file 
  into the includer. That means you've essentially created one big file. 
  If you do this with lots of data, you'll have one <i>very</i> big 
  file. This will cost huge amounts of memory, and slows down  
  compilation. Doesn't mean much at first, but as projects get bigger, 
  it will become annoying to say the least. There also seems to be a 
  limit on the amount of memory the compiler can use anyway, which 
  means there is a limit on the amount of data you <i>can</i> include.
<li>
  <b>Recompiling the world</b>.
  Aside from that, #including everything means compiling everything 
  again as well. Again, on bigger projects, this can mean a lot.<br>
  With separate compilation, you only need to re-compile 
  files that have actually changed. This is also how libraries work: 
  you precompile code which you can just link to your project at no 
  extra cost.
<li><b>Code bloat</b>.
   When using libraries, only the parts used will actually be linked; 
   with #include, you include <i>everything</i>, which bloats the code 
   to no end. 
<li>
  <b>Multiple definitions</b>.
  Definitions can only happen once in a file. By including everything 
  there is the definite possibility of including the same thing multiple 
  times, which gives &lsquo;multiple definition&rsquo; errors.
<li>
  <b>Data alignment</b>. I'll get to what this means in a minute, but for 
  now know that it's best if data is aligned to word boundaries. This 
  is usually guaranteed if you compile separately, but with #include 
  it will almost certainly not be the case.
</ul>

<p>
So just do yourself a favor and don't #include every file into 
<tt>main.c</tt> or whatever you're calling it. Header files are for 
preprocessor directives and declarations, not actual code or data. 
If it creates binary data, do not #include it.
</p>

<div class="note">
<div class="nhbad">Header files should not contain code or data</div>
<p>
The point of header files is to have <dfn>metadata</dfn>: stuff that 
isn't compiled itself, but that <i>helps</i> you in other files. When 
you compile code or data, it'll create <dfn>symbols</dfn>, binary 
data of actual substance that is used by the final program itself.
</p>
</div>

<p>
To see how it's done properly, look at tonc's demo code. There is 
also a good (and technical) discussion of it

  Proper build procedure</h3>

<h4>Separate compilation</h4>
<p>
So what do you do instead? Well, for starters keep all the code 
and data in separate source files. Compile these separately by 
invoking gcc on each file. This gives you a list of object files. 
These you then link together. In batch files, you'd need to 
add extra commands for each file, but a properly setup makefile 
uses a list of object files, and the makefile's rules will then 
take care of the rest automatically. Using the makefile of the 
<a href="first.htm#ssec-2nd-make">second demo</a> as a reference, 
you'll get something like this:
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="cmt"># partial makefile for using multiple source files
# some steps omitted for clarity</span>

<span class="cmt"># 3 targets for compilation</span>
OBJS    := foo.o bar.o boo.o

<span class="cmt"># link step: .o -&gt; .elf</span>
$(PROJ).elf : $(OBJS)
	$(LD) $^ $(LDFLAGS) -o $@

<span class="cmt"># compile step .c -&gt; .o</span>
$(OBJS) : %.o : %.c
	$(CC) -c $&lt; $(CFLAGS) -o $@
</pre>
<p>
The <code>OBJS</code> variable contains the names of three object 
files, which would be the targets of compiling <tt>foo.c</tt>, 
<tt>bar.c</tt> and <tt>boo.c</tt>. Remember, makefiles list rules by 
target, not by prerequisite. The compilation step uses a static 
pattern rule, which for each &lsquo;.o&rsquo; file in 
<code>OBJS</code> compiles the &lsquo;.c&rsquo; file with the same 
title. This is what runs the compiler for our three source files. 
In the linking step the automatic variable <code>$^</code> expands 
to the prerequisites of the rule, which is the list of all object
files, and this is how the files are all linked together. If you
need more files, add them to the <code>OBJS</code> list.
</p>
<p>
Note that the devkitPro and tonc template files take care of these
things automatically. Just put the source files into the right directory 
and you're good to go.
</p>

<h4>Symbols, declarations and definitions</h4>
<p>
If you have been doing everything via #include, you should consider 
refactoring all of your stuff to separate source files. No, let me 
rephrase that, you <i>need</i> to do this because you'll benefit 
from it in the end. If you're already well in your project, this is 
going to suck because it's boring and time consuming and most likely 
it's not even going to <i>work</i> properly when you try the first 
build afterwards. I expect you'll get a whole slew of errors, 
particularly these three:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>`foo' undeclared
  <li>redefinition of `foo'
  <li>multiple definition of `foo'
</ul>

<p>
To understand what these mean, you need to know a little bit more about 
how C (and indeed programs) actually works.
</p><br>

<p>
As I said before, there aren't really things like programs, bitmaps, 
sound on computers; it's all just bits. Bits, bits and more bits. What
makes a sequence of bits work as a program is the way it is fed to 
the CPU, VRAM, and other sections. Somewhere in the build process, 
there has to be a translation of all the C code to data and 
machine instructions. This, of course, is the compiler's job.
</p>
<p>
But wait, there's more. C allows you to compile each file separately, 
and then link them later into the actual program. This is a good 
idea, because it allows you to save time by only compiling the 
files that you have recently modified, as well as the use of code 
<dfn>libraries</dfn>, which are little more than a bunch of 
precompiled source files. If you're not convinced that this is a 
good idea, consider what it would take without it. You'd have to have 
<i>all</i> the source code that you wanted to use (including 
for things like <code>printf()</code> and all the API code), and 
compile all those megabytes of source files each time. Sounds like 
fun? No, I didn't think so either.
</p>
<p>
However, you need a little more bookkeeping to make this all work. 
Because everything is just bits, you'd need a way to find out 
where the function or data you want to use actually is. The 
contents of the compiled files (the object files) isn't just raw 
binary, it contains <dfn>symbols</dfn>. This is just a word for the 
group of things that have actual binary information attached to 
them. Among other things, the object file keeps track of 
the symbol's name, section, size, and where its content 
is in the object file. A function is a symbol, because it contains
instructions. A variable is also a symbol, as is data for bitmaps, 
sound, maps et cetera. Preprocessor #defines, typedefs and 
struct/class declarations are <i>not</i> symbols, because they only 
don't have actual content in them, but allow you to structure your 
code better.
</p>
<p>
The other bookkeeping note is that each source/object file is a 
separate entity. In principle, it knows nothing about the outside 
world. This makes sense because it limits the dependency on other 
files, but it does create a little problem when you want to make 
files work together. This is where <dfn>declarations</dfn> come in.
</p>
<p>
You may have noticed that C is pretty strict when it comes to 
names of stuff. Before you can use anything, it requires you to 
mention what it is beforehand. For example, if you use a function 
<code>foo()</code> in your code and you never defined its code, 
or even if you put it after the call to <code>foo()</code>, the 
compiler will complain that it doesn't know what you're talking 
about. That is, it will say that &lsquo;`foo' is undeclared&rsquo;. 
You have to admit it has a right to stop there: how would it know 
how to use the thing if you never told it what it was? 
</p>
<p>
The code snippet below gives an example of when a reference is and 
is not declared, and why it's important to have a declaration. 
Function <code>a()</code> calls <code>foo()</code>, which is not
known at the time, so an error is produced. Function 
<code>b()</code> also calls <code>foo()</code>, which <i>is</i> 
known at that time, but still gives an error because 
<code>foo()</code> just happens to require an integer as an argument. 
If the declaration wasn't mandatory and the call in 
<code>a()</code> was allowed, <code>foo()</code> would have been 
processing the wrong kind of information at runtime. There are ways 
around such problems, of course, languages like PHP, VB and others 
work fine without mandatory declarations, but the cost for that is 
speed and possibly a lot more runtime errors.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="cmt">//# C requires identifiers to be declared or defined before first use.</span>

<span class="cmt">// ERROR: `foo' is undefined.</span>
<span class="keyw">void</span> a()
{
    foo();

<span class="cmt">// Definition of foo(). Now the system 'knows' what foo is.</span>

}

<span class="cmt">// foo is known but used incorrectly. Compiler issues error.</span>
<span class="keyw">void</span> c()
{
    foo();
}
</pre>

<p>
Now back to our separate files, and the difference between declarations 
and definitions of symbols. A <dfn>definition</dfn> is something of 
actual content: it is what actually forms the symbol. Examples are the 
value(s) in variables, and the code in functions. A 
<dfn>declaration</dfn> is just an empty reference. It just says that 
there is <i>something</i> in the project with a particular name, and 
indicates how that something is supposed to be used: whether it's a 
function or variable, what datatype, which arguments, that sort of 
things. This is how you can use symbols from other object files.
</p>
<p>
You should be familiar with what a definition looks like. A declaration 
looks very similar. The basic variable declaration is the variable name 
and attributes (type, const, section) preceded by <code>extern</code>. 
For functions, replace the code block by a semi-colon. 
You can also add <code>extern</code> there, but it's not required.
</p>

<pre class="proglist">
<span class="cmt">// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// DECLARATIONS. Put these in source (.c) or header (.h) files.
// --------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="keyw">extern int</span> var;
<span class="keyw">extern const unsigned int</span> data[<span 
class="num">256</span>];
<span class="keyw">void</span> foo(<span class="keyw">int</span> x);


<span class="cmt">// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// DEFINITIONS. Put these in source (.c) only.
// --------------------------------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="cmt">// uninitialized definition</span>
<span class="keyw">int</span> var;

<span class="cmt">// initialized definition</span>
<span class="keyw">const unsigned int</span> data[<span 
class="num">256</span>]=
{
    <span class="cmt">// data</span>
};

<span class="keyw">void</span> foo(<span class="keyw">int</span> x)
{
    <span class="cmt">// code</span>
}
</pre>

<p>
Now, a definition is also a declaration, but this does <i>not</i> work 
the other way. How can it, the declaration is supposed to be empty. 
The distinction is subtle, but it's the reason you might get multiple 
definition errors when linking the files together. Think of what would 
happen if you have the definition of function <code>foo()</code> 
in multiple files. Each file itself would know what <code>foo()</code> 
is because definitions are also declarations, so it would pass the 
compilation stage. So now you have multiple object files, each 
containing a symbol called <code>foo</code>. But then you try to 
link them into one file. The linker sees different versions of 
<code>foo</code>, and stops because it doesn't know which one you are 
actually trying to use. The moral here is that you can have as many 
declarations as you want, but there can be only <i>one</i> definition.
</p>
<p>
Another point I should raise is that the declaration 
defines how a symbol is to be dealt with, as it is the only point of 
reference if the definition is in another file. This means that, in 
theory, you could have a variable <code>var</code> defined as an int, 
but declared as a short, or even a function! While not exactly 
recommended, but it is an interesting item.
</p>
<p>
Lastly: the distinction of what should go in source files, and 
what in headers. Source files can actually contain anything, so that's 
an easy one. Remember that they will contain everything after the 
preprocessor step anyway, because that's what #include really does. 
So what matters is what you put in headers. The purpose of header 
files is to have a place for all the <b>non-symbol</b> stuff that you 
want to use in different source files. That means declarations, 
#defines, macros, typedefs, struct/class descriptions. 
It also means (static) inline functions, because these don't form 
symbols either, but are integrated in the functions that call them. 
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
All this stuff about separate compilation, declarations, and 
definitions is rather important for C programming, but the preceding 
text may be a little much to take in at once. So here is a summary of 
the most important points.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>Symbols</b>. Symbols are those parts of the code that form actual 
  binary content in the final program. This includes functions, 
  variables, data, but not preprocessor or type description stuff.
<li>
  <b>Declarations/definitions</b>. A definition of a symbol is where 
  the actual content is. A declaration just says that something of 
  a certain name exists, but will be added to the project later. 
  Multiple (identical) declarations may exist, but there can be only 
  one definition in the project. Definitions are also declarations.
<li>
  <b>Source/object files are selfcontained entities</b>. They contain 
  the definitions of the symbols that are in the code, and a list of 
  references to outside symbols, as indicated by the declarations.
<li>
  <b>Header files contain meta-data, not symbols</b>. Header files 
  cannot be compiled, but are intended contain the &lsquo;glue&rsquo; 
  that allow difference sources to work together (i.e., declarations) 
  and stuff that makes writing the sources easier (like #defines and 
  macros). They are meant to be included in multiple files, so they 
  cannot create symbols because that would lead to multiple 
  definitions.
</ul>

<p>
Potential problems during compilation or linking:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <b>`foo' undeclared</b>. Compiler error. The identifier `foo' is not 
  known at this point. Check the spelling, or add the appropriate 
  declaration or header file containing the declaration.
<li>
  <b>redefinition of `foo'</b>. Compiler error. The identifier as a 
  previous declaration or definition conflicting with the current one 
  in the same file or included headers. Usually accompanied by a message 
  of the previous definition.
<li>
  <b>multiple definition of 'foo'</b>. Linker error. The symbol 
  name `foo' is shared by multiple object files. Replace all but one 
  definitions of `foo' in the source files with the appropriate 
  declarations. Usually accompanied with a message indicating the 
  object file with the other definition(s).
</ul>

<h3 id="ssec-data-align">5.4.5.
  Data alignment</h3>
<p>
Data alignment is about the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; memory addresses of 
variables. It is often beneficial to have a variable of a certain 
length to start at an address divisible by that length. For example, 
a 32-bit variable likes to be put at addresses that are a multiple of 
4. Processors themselves also have certain preferred alignments. 
Addressing will work faster if you stick to their native types and 
alignment (say, 32-bit everything for 32-bit CPUs). For PCs it is not 
required to do any of this, it'll just run slower. For RISC systems, 
however, things <i>must</i> be aligned properly or data gets mangled. 
</p>
<p>
In most cases, the compiler will align things for you. It will put 
all halfwords on even boundaries and words on quad-byte boundaries. 
As long as you stick to the normal programming rules, you can remain 
completely oblivious to this alignment stuff. Except that you 
<i>won't</i> always stick to the rules. In fact, C is a language that 
allows you to break the rules whenever you feel like it. It trusts you 
to know what you're doing. Whether that trust is always justified is 
another matter <kbd>:P</kbd>
</p>
<p>
The best example of breaking the rules is pointer casting. For example, 
most graphics converters will output the data as u16-arrays, so you 
can copy it to VRAM with a simple for-loop. You can speed up copying 
by roughly 160% if you copy by words (32-bit) rather than 
halfwords (16-bit). Run the <a href="text.htm#ssec-demo-se2">txt_se2</a> 
demo and see for yourself. All you have to do for this is one or two 
pointer casts, as shown here.
</p>

<pre class="proglist" id="cd-array-cpy">
<span class="keyw">#define</span> fooSize ...
<span class="keyw">const</span> u16 fooData[]= { ... };

<span class="cmt">// copy via u16 array (the de facto standard)</span>
u16 *dst= (u16*)vid_mem, *src= (u16*)fooData;
<span class="keyw">for</span>(ii=<span 
class="num">0</span>; ii&lt;fooSize/<span class="num">2</span>; ii++)
    dst[ii]= src[ii];

<span class="cmt">// copy via u32 array (mooch faster)</span>
u32 *dst= (u32*)vid_mem, *src= (u32*)fooData;
<span class="keyw">for</span>(ii=<span 
class="num">0</span>; ii&lt;fooSize/<span class="num">4</span>; ii++)
     dst[ii]= src[ii];
</pre>

<p>
Both these routines copy <code>fooSize</code> bytes from 
<code>fooData</code> to VRAM. Only the second version is much faster 
because there are half as many loop iterations and also because the 
ARM CPU is just better at dealing with 32-bit chunks. The only danger 
here is that while <code>fooData</code> will be halfword aligned, 
it need <i>not</i> be word aligned, which is a requirement for the 
second version. For those readers that think casts like this and 
mis-alignment only happen to other people, think again: the 
faster copy routines (<code>memcpy()</code>, <code>CpuFastSet()</code>, 
and DMA too) cast to word-pointers implicitly. Use them (and you 
should) and you run the risk of misalignment.
</p>
<p>
There are many ways of ensuring proper alignment. The easiest way is 
to not mix converted data with the rest of your stuff. That is, don't 
#include data-files. This should suffice. Another method is to 
convert to u32-arrays in the first place. In assembly files, you can 
control alignment by using the &lsquo;.align <i>n</i>&rsquo; 
directive, where <i>n</i> aligns to 2<sup>n</sup> bytes. C itself 
doesn't allow manual alignment, but there is an extension for this 
in GCC: &lsquo;<code>__attribute__(( aligned(4) ))</code>&rsquo;. Add 
that to the definition and it'll be word aligned. This is often 
#defined as <code>ALIGN4</code> in some headers. Files in GBFS are 
also always correctly aligned.
</p>

<h4>Struct alignment</h4>
<p>
One other area where alignment can cause problems is in struct 
definitions. Look at the following code. Here we have a struct 
named <code>FOO</code> consisting of one byte, <i>b</i>, one word 
<i>w</i> and one halfword <i>h</i>. So that's 1+4+2=7 bytes for the 
struct right? Wrong. Because of the alignment requirement, <i>w</i>
doesn't immediately follow <i>b</i> but leaves 3 bytes of padding. 
When defining arrays of this type, you'll also see that there 
are also two padding bytes after <i>h</i>, because otherwise later 
array-entries would run into trouble. 
</p>

<pre class="proglist" id="cd-struct-align">
<span class="cmt">// one byte, one word, one halfword. 7 byte struct? 
// Well let's see ...</span>
<span class="keyw">struct</span> FOO

// 40 00 00 00 | 41 42 43 44 | 45 46 00 00</span>
</pre>

<p>
The <i>real</i> size is actually 12 bytes. Not only is this almost 
twice the size, if you ever try to copy the array using a hard-coded 7 
rather than <code>sizeof(struct FOO)</code>, you completely mess it 
up. Take this lesson to heart. It's a very easy mistake to make and 
difficult to detect after the fact. If you were unaware of this fact 
and you've already done some GBA coding, check your structs (or 
classes) now; chances are there are gaps that shouldn't be there. 
Simply rearranging some of the members should suffice to make them fit 
better. Note that this is not specific to the GBA: structs on PCs 
may behave the same way, as I noticed when I was writing my TGA 
functions.
</p>
<p>
There are ways of forcing packing, using the 
&lsquo;<code>__attribute__((packed))</code>&rsquo; attribute. If the 
<code>FOO</code> struct had that, it really would be 7 bytes long. 
The downside of this is that the non-byte members could be 
mis-aligned and have to be put together byte for byte (the compiler 
does this for you). This is very much slower than the non-packed 
version, so only use this attribute if you have no other choice.




What 
happens with mis-aligned (half)words then I can't tell you though, but 
I'm sure it's not pretty.

<h4 id="sssec-devkit-align">Devkits and struct alignment</h4>
<p>
As far as I've been able to tell, structs have always had word 
alignment. This was useful because it made copying structs 
faster. C allows you to copy structs with a single assignment, 
just like the standard data types. Because of the word-alignment, 
these copies are fast because GCC will make use of ARM's block-copy 
instructions, which are much faster than copying member by member.
</p>
<p>
However, this does not seem to be true under devkitARM r19 (and 
presumably higher) anymore. The new rule seems to be 
&ldquo;structs are aligned to their largest member&rdquo;. This 
does make more sense as a struct of two bytes would actually be 
two bytes long. However, it does mean that GCC will now call 
<code>memcpy()</code> for non-aligned structs. Apart from it 
being a function with quite a bit of overhead (i.e., it's 
<i>very</i> slow if you want to copy a single small struct), 
it will actually <b>fail</b> to produce correct results in some 
cases. The problem is that low-number copies it will copy by the 
byte, which is something you cannot do for VRAM, PALRAM or OAM. 
For example, objects that we'll see later use a struct of four 
halfwords; using a struct-copy there, something I am very fond 
of doing, screws up everything. The only way to make it work 
properly is to force word-alignment on the struct.

<p>
The rules for struct alignment have changed since devkitARM r19.
Instead of being always word-aligned, they are now aligned as 
well as their members will allow. If this means they're not 
necessarily word-aligned, then they will use 
<code>memcpy()</code> for struct-copies, which is slow for 
small structs, and may even be wrong (see 
<a href="#ssec-data-memcpy">next section</a>). If you want to 
be able to do struct copies fast and safe, either force 
alignment or cast to other datatypes. 
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ssec-data-memcpy">5.4.6.
  Copying, memcpy() and sizeof</h3>
<p>
There are many different ways of copying data on this platform. Arrays, 
struct-copies, standard copiers like <code>memcpy()</code>, and GBA 
specific routines like <code>CpuFastSet()</code> and DMA. All of these 
have their own strengths and weaknesses. All of them can be affected by 
misalignment and the no-byte-write rule. I discuss some of them in the
<a href="text.htm#ssec-demo-se2">txt_se2</a> demo.
</p>
<p>
I've chosen to use <code>memcpy()</code> in the early demos for 
a number of reasons. The main one is that it is part of the standard 
C library, meaning that C programmers should already be familiar with 
it. Secondly, it is somewhat optimized (see the 
<tt>txt_se2</tt> demo for details). However, there are two potential 
pitfalls with the routine. The first is data alignment (yes, <i>that</i> 
again). If <i>either</i> the source <i>or</i> the destination is not 
word-aligned, you're in trouble. Secondly, if the number of bytes is 
too small, you're in trouble too.
</p>
<p>
Both of these have to do with the basic function of 
<code>memcpy()</code>, namely to be a fast <i>byte</i> copier. But 
as you know, you can't copy single bytes to VRAM directly. 
Fortunately, it has an optimised mode that uses an unrolled 
word-copy loop if two conditions are satisfied:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>When both source and destinations are word aligned.
  <li>When you are copying more than 16 bytes.
</ol>
<p>
This is usually the case so I figured it'd be safe enough for the 
demos. There are also look-alikes in tonclib that do the same thing 
only better, namely <code>memcpy16()</code> and 
<code>memcpy32()</code>, but these are in assembly so I thought I 
wouldn't lay them on you so soon. Highly recommended for later 
though. 
</p>
<p>
On a related subject, there is also <code>memset()</code> for 
memory fills. Be careful with that one, because that will <i>only</i> 
work with bytes. Tonclib also includes 16- and 32-bit versions of 
this routine, but also in assembly. 
</p><br>

<p>
The last thing I want to discuss is the <code>sizeof()</code> 
operator. In other tutorials you will see this being used to find 
the size in bytes of arrays, which is then used in 
<code>memcpy()</code>. It's a good procedure but will not always 
work. First, <code>sizeof()</code> actually gives the size of the 
<i>variable</i>, which need not always be the array itself. For 
example, if you use it on a pointer to the array, it'll give the 
size of the pointer and <i>not</i> of the array. The compiler 
never complains, but you might when hardly anything is copied. 
Secondly, <code>sizeof()</code> is an <i>operator</i>, not a 
function. It is resolved at compile-time, so it needs to be able 
to find the size at that time as well. To do this, either 
the declaration (in the header) should indicate the size, or 
the array definition (in the source file) should be visible.
</p>
<p>
Bottom line: you can use <code>sizeof()</code>, just pay attention to 
what you use it on.
</p><br>

<p>
Okay, that was the long and boring &ndash;yet necessary&ndash; 
section on data. Congratulations if you've managed to stay awake till
this point, especially if you've actually understood all of it. 
It's okay if you didn't though, in most cases you won't run into the 
problems discussed here. But just remember this section for if you do 
run into trouble when copying and you can't find it in the code; it 
might save you a few hours of debugging.

<h3 id="ssec-data-demo">5.4.7.
  Data interpretation demo</h3>
<p>
The <tt>bm_modes</tt> is an example of how the same data can result 
in different results depending on interpretation (in this case, modes 3, 
4 and 5). In the code below, I make <i>one</i> copy into VRAM, and 
switch between the modes using Left and Right. The results can be seen 
in figs 5.7a-c. 
</p>
<p>
I've arranged the data of the bitmap in such a way that the name of 
the current mode can be read clearly, as well as indicated the mode's 
boundaries in memory. Because the data intended for the other modes 
is still present, but not interpreted as intended, that part of the 
bitmap will look a little shitty. And that's partly the point of the 
demo: when filling VRAM, you need to know how the GBA will use the 
data in it, and make sure it'll be used. If the bitmap ends up being 
all garbled, this is the likely suspect; check the bitdepth, 
dimensions and format (linear, tiled, compressed, etc) and if 
something conflicts, fix it.
</p>
<p>
Now, sometimes this is not as easy as it sounds. The general 
procedure for graphics is to create it on the PC, then use an exporter 
tool to convert it to a raw binary format, then copy it to VRAM. If 
the exporter has been given the wrong options, or if it can't handle 
the image in the first place, you'll get garbage. This can happen 
with some of the older tools. In some cases, it's the bitmap editor 
that is the culprit. For paletted images, a lot depends on the 
exact layout of the palette, and therefore it is <b>vital</b> that 
you have a bitmap editor that allows total control over the palette, 
and leaves it intact when saving. MS-Paint for example does neither. 
Even very expensive photo editing tools don't, so be careful.
</p>
<p>
For this image, I used &lt;plug&gt;my own bitmap editor 
<a href="http://www.coranac.com/projects/#usenti" target="_blank">Usenti</a>&lt;/plug&gt;, 
which not only has some nice palette control options, and tiling 
functions, but a built-in GBA graphics exporter as well. To make the 
background be the same color in all modes, the two bytes of the 
16bit background color of modes 3 and 5 had to serve as palette 
entries for mode 4, both using that 16bit color again. In this case, 
the color is <code>0x080F</code>, sort of a brownish color. The bytes 
are 8 and 15, so that's the palette entries where the color goes too. 
Normally you don't have to worry about switching bitdepths mid-game, 
but knowing how to read data like this is a useful debugging skill.

<h2 id="sec-conc">Conclusions</h2>
<p>
Now we've seen some of the basics of the GBA bitmap modes: the 
properties of modes 3, 4 and 5, page flipping, rudimentary drawing 
for mode 3 and one of the most important rules of VRAM interactions: 
you cannot write to VRAM in bytes. There is much more that can be 
said, of course. Bitmap graphics is a rich subject, but going into 
more detail right now may not be the best idea. For one, the bitmap 
modes are very rarely used in games anyway, but also because there 
are other things to talk about as well. Things like button input, 
which is what the next chapter is about.
</p>
<p>
This chapter also discussed a few things about handling data, a very 
important topic when you're this close to the hardware. Datatypes 
matter, especially when accessing memory through pointers, and you 
need to be aware of the differences between them, and the 
opportunities and dangers of each. Even if you don't remember every 
little detail in the data section, at least remember where to look 
when things go screwy.
</p>
<p>
Before continuing with further chapters, this may be a good time to 
do some experimenting with data: try changing the data arrays and see
what happens. Look at the different data interpretations, different 
casts, and maybe some intentional errors as well, just to see what 
kinds of problems you might face at some point. It's better to make 
mistakes early, while programs are still short and simple and you 
have less potential problems.
</p><br>

<p>
Or not, of course <kbd>:P</kbd>. Maybe it's worth waiting a little 
longer with that; or at least until we've covered basic input, which 
allows for much more interesting things than just passive images.
