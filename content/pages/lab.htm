  Lab introduction</h2>
<p>
The Lab stands for &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo;, a place for me to 
toy with new stuff. If I have something new that may be useful, 
but isn't quite ready to be up anywhere else yet, I'll put it here 
for a while. It does mean it may get messy at times, but that's 
alright because that's what laboratories are for anyway. As a 
by-product, &ldquo;lab&rdquo; may double for 
&ldquo;labyrinth&rdquo;, but that's just a little bonus 
<kbd>:)</kbd>.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-prio">24.2.
  Priority and drawing order</h2>
<p>
This section covers the last of the bits in the background and object 
control that I haven't discussed yet: <dfn>priority</dfn>. 
There are four priority levels, 0-3, and you can set the priority for 
backgrounds in 
<a href="regbg.htm#tbl-reg-bgxcnt">REG_BGxCNT</a> bits 0 and 1, 
and for objects in 
<a href="regobj.htm#tbl-oe-attr2">attribute 2</a>, bits 10 and 11. 
The concept of priority 
is simple: higher priorities are rendered first, so they appear behind
things with a lower priority. This will allow you to 
have objects behind backgrounds, for example.
</p>
<p>
This all sounds very simple, and it is, but there is a little more to 
the order of the rendering process than this. On the one hand you have
the priority settings, on the other you have the obj and bg 
<dfn>numbers</dfn>. 
Objects are numbered 0 to 127, backgrounds from 0 to 3. Again, higher
numbers appear behind lower numbers: in a stack of objects, obj 0 is 
on top; bg 0 covers the others, and objects are drawn in front of 
backgrounds. This is <i>not</i> due to the priority settings; in fact 
the whole point of priorities is so that the default order can be 
altered.
</p>
<p>
The above is true for objects and backgrounds of <i>the same</i> 
priority. You could argue that the final obj/bg order is composed of
both the priority and the obj/bg number, where priority is the most 
significant part. So if, for example you have obj 1 and bg 2 at
priority 0, and obj 0 and bg 1 at priority 1, the order would be
obj1 (prio0), bg2 (prio0), obj0 (prio1), bg1 (prio1).
</p>
<p>
Well, <i>mostly</i> &hellip;
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-prio-objsort">24.2.1.
  The object-priority bug and object sorting</h3>
<p>
For the most part, the order is as mentioned above, except for the 
parts where obj 0 and obj 1 overlap. Due to a, well I guess you can 
call it a design flaw, the notion of order = priority.number isn't 
quite true: if you have two objects in which the priorities and 
numbers are asymmetrical and there is a background in between, the 
object that's supposed to be below the background will shine through 
the background in the region where the two objects overlap. This 
sounds very complicated, but that's just because words can't really 
capture what happens. Basically, something like
obj1+prio0, bg0+prio0, obj0+prio1 will cause a pretty nasty graphical
artifact if the rectangles of these objects overlap. However, 
obj0+prio0, bg0+prio0, obj1+prio1 will work fine, because the object 
numbers are now in line with the priorities.
</p><br>

<p>
Which brings us to <dfn>object sorting</dfn>: the process of making 
sure the object that should be first will actually <i>be</i> first, 
i.e., have a lower obj number. This is actually a separate issue 
from priorities, but it's nice to do them both in one go. In principle,
an object sort is a sort like any other: you have an array or list of 
things, in this case OBJ_ATTR's, and you have to put them into order 
via some sort of <dfn>key</dfn>, a value that indicates what the sorted 
order should be.
</p>
<p>
Now, the key can basically be anything. A lot of top-down or isometric 
games use Y-sorting, as higher Y-values means the object is more in the
foreground. 3D and mode 7 games can use Z-sorting, of which Y-sorting 
is technically a special case.</p>
<p>
You'll also need a sorting algorithm. There are plenty of them to 
choose from the  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm" target="_blank">wiki on 
sorting algorithms</a>. When picking an algorithm, remember that 
the number of items to sort here is maybe about a hundred tops, and 
that it's likely that the items don't change order all that often. 
Finally, you need a way to put the whole thing together; make it 
work with the sprite and OBJ_ATTR structs that you have.
</p><br>

<p>
For the moment, I've chosen primarily for <i>simplicity</i>, not 
speed. The sorter, <code>id_sort_shell()</code>, uses a slightly 
modified version of the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_sort" target="_blank">shell-sort</a> 
algorithm found in Numerical Recipes (ch 8, pp 321). Its parameters 
are an array of key values and the number of elements. However, it 
does not sort these directly (which would be fairly pointless as 
they're not tied to objects here), but keeps track of the 
sorting results in an index table, <code>ids[]</code>.
</p>
<p>
An <dfn>index table</dfn> is, well, a table of indices, obviously; 
it will provide the sorted order of the keys after the routine has 
finished. This strategy allows me to keep the object double buffer 
intact, which I like because it makes sprite management 
simpler. Also, I don't have to swap whole structs (although that's 
usually done by pointers anyway), and it makes the routine 
usable as a general sorter, not just for objects. The choice of bytes 
as the type for the index table does limit this, but that's just one 
of those space trade-offs one has to make sometimes. Changing it to 
use full integers isn't exactly hard, of course.

<p>
Note that I intend the routine to be in IWRAM (and compiled as 
ARM code) because it's so <b>very f%#$@*g slow</b>! Or perhaps I 
shouldn't say slow, just costly.
</p>
<p>
Think of how a basic sort works. You have <i>N</i> elements to sort. 
In principle, each of these has to be checked with every other element, 
so that the routine's speed is proportional to <i>N</i><sup>2</sup>, 
usually expressed as <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>), where the 
<i>O</i> stands for order of magnitude. For sorting, 
<i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>) is bad. For example, when <i>N</i>=128, 
you would be looking at 16k checks. Times the number of cycles that 
the actual checks and updates would take. Not pleasant.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there are faster methods, you'd want at least an 
<i>O</i>(<i>N</i>&middot;log<sub>2</sub>(<i>N</i>)) for sorting 
algorithms, and as you can see from the aforementioned wiki, there 
are plenty of those and shellsort is one of them. Unfortunately, even 
this can be quite expensive. Again, with <i>N</i>=128 this is still 
about 900, and you can be sure the multiplier can be high, as in 80+. 
With ARM+IWRAM, I can manage to bring that down to 20-30, and a simple 
exercise in assembly gives me an acceptable
13 to 22 &times; <i>N</i>&middot;log<sub>2</sub>(<i>N</i>). 
</p>

<div class="note">
<div class="nh">The Big O Notation</div>
<p>
The &lsquo;Big O&rsquo; or order notation is a useful
expression for comparing algorithms. The notation is 
<i>O</i>( f(<i>N</i>) ), where <i>N</i> is the number of 
elements to work on and f(<i>N</i>) a function, usually a combination 
of powers and logarithms. It shows how the runtime of an algorithm 
rises with increasing <i>N</i>. As lower order functions will 
eventually be overtaken by higher order ones, the former is generally 
preferable.
</p>
<p>
The keyword here, though, is &lsquo;eventually&rsquo;. It does not 
mention the scale of the algorithm, which varies from case to case.
In some cases if <i>N</i> is low enough and the scales are different 
enough, a higher-order routine may actually outperform a lower-order 
one.
</p> 
</div><br>

<p>
Now, I'll be the first to admit that the current design isn't exactly 
optimal anyway. Using linked lists instead of an index table may work 
faster, and there are other things too (the division isn't a problem, 
as <a href="fixed.htm#sec-rmdiv">it can be faked</a>). 
However, then it wouldn't be quite as simple anymore, which is what 
I was going for here. 
</p>
<p>
Once <code>id_sort_shell()</code> is finished, we have an table of 
indices arranged in such a way that <code>obj_buffer[sort_ids[ii]]</code> 
gives the sorted OAM entries, which is used to update to the real OAM.
</p>

<h3 id="ssec-prio-demo">24.2.2.
  Caged DNA</h3>

<p>
The demo for this section is probably the coolest and most 
complicated one yet. It features a double helix of objects, revolving 
around the center of a toroidal cage (see 
24.1). All four backgrounds are used here, 
one for text (little as there is of that), and three parts of the 
cage: one front end, which obscures the objects, one back end that 
lies behind everything else and the middle of the toroid around which 
the the object rotate, i.e., they pass both in front and behind it at 
different times. And then there are the objects that form the helix. 
The two strands each consist of 48 spherical 16x16 objects. 
The strands are distinguishable by their colors:  one is red and the 
other cyan. These will turn to dark red and cyan as they pass behind 
the central plane. Priority settings are used to allow the objects to 
pass behind nearer backgrounds, and priorities <i>and</i> sorting 
make the object order smooth and avoid the previously mentioned 
obj-bg-obj bug. To summarize:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 backgrounds with varying priority settings
  <li>96 objects revolving (in 3D) around a central pillar.
  <li>Object priorities and number sorting to ensure proper order.
  <li>Palette swapping to distinguish near from far objects.
</ul>
<p>
You can see a schematic representation of the whole thing in

<h4>Sprites and the helix pattern</h4>
<p>
As you can imagine, the sprite part is the trickiest thing about 
this demo. The helix is inherently a three dimensional path, so 
we need a 3D vector for each orb's position, with the coordinates 
being fixed-point numbers, of course. It also needs an index to the 
OAM shadow, linking a sprite (the orb) to the right OBJ_ATTR (the 
object on screen).

</div>

<p>
A helix is simply a circle parameterization extruded in the direction 
of its normal axis (see fig&nbsp;24.2). Note the 
directions of the three principle axes: it is a right-handed system, 
with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> following the directions of the screens 
axes, and <i>z</i> pointing into the screen. A helix rotating around 
the <i>y</i>-axis can be described by the following relation:
</p>

<table id="eq-helix">
<tr>
  <td class="eqnrcell">(24.1)
  <td class="eqcell"> <b>x</b>(t) &nbsp;=&nbsp;
  <td class="eqcell">
  <table class="eqtbl" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
  <tbody align="center">
  <tr>
    <td class="bdrLL" rowspan=3>&nbsp;
    <td><i>A</i>·cos(<i>k</i>·<i>y</i>+&omega;<i>t</i>)
    <td class="bdrRR" rowspan=3>&nbsp;
  <tr>
    <td> <i>y</i>
  <tr>
    <td><i>A</i>sin(<i>k</i>·<i>y</i>+&omega;<i>t</i>)
  </tbody>
  </table>
</table>

<p>
<i>A</i> is the radius of the helix, <i>k</i> is the wave number 
(<i>k</i>=2&pi;/&lambda;) and &omega; the angular velocity 
(&omega;=2&pi;/<i>T</i>). The wave number defines the spacing 
between the layers of the helix (i.e., the pitch), the angular 
velocity gives the speed of rotation. Note that to create the 
helix in fig&nbsp;24.2 I actually need a negative 
wave number, but that's not really important right now.
</p>
<p>
In the actual code I'm going to make a slight change to the formula 
above to make &omega; variable without upsetting the whole helix. 
Instead of simply &omega;<i>t</i>, I'll use the integration of it 
for the initial phase angle: 
&phi;<sub>0</sub>=&int;&omega;(<i>t</i>)d<i>t</i>. &phi;<sub>0</sub> 
will be a parameter to the function that creates the helix, and 
managed elsewhere. Another parameter for the pattern is 
<b>p</b><sub>0</sub>, the reference point of the helix. You gotta 
have one of those.

<p>
The routine is fairly straightforward. A running counter for the 
<i>y</i> is kept in the form of <code>dp.y</code>, which is used to 
calculate the full phase, from which we get our sines and cosines. 
Since the red and cyan helices are in counter-phase, I can simply 
get the <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> offsets for one by switching the signs 
of the other. The only really tricky part is managing the different 
fixed point scales for the phase; when dealing with fixed point math, 
always indicate the number of fractional bits, it's so very easy to 
get lost there.
</p><br>

<p>
Now that we have the double helix pattern, we need a way to link it 
to the objects, complete with sorting and all.

The big loop here updates the OAM shadow, <i>not the real OAM</i>! 
It updates the object's position using the sprites <i>x</i> and 
<i>y</i> (corrected for fixed point, of course), and uses <i>z</i> 
to set the priority: 1 if it's on the near side (before the central 
pillar), and 2 if it's on the far side (behind the pillar). It 
<i>also</i> does something funky with the palette, which is the first 
hack in the function, shortly followed by the second one.

<p>
<b>Hack 1</b>. I've arranged the object palette in such a way 
that the reds are in palette banks 4 and 5, and the cyans in banks 
6 and 7 (table 24.2). This means that 
I can switch between the light and dark versions by toggling the 
first pal-bank bit, (attr2{C}).
</p>
<p>
Immediately after this is the second hack, creating the sort key.
</p>
<p>
<b>Hack 2</b>. The sort key is a combination of the priority (2 bits) 
and the depth <i>z</i> (the rest). The lower 30 bits of <code>zz</code> 
work as a <b>signed</b> offset for the priority levels, so that each 
priority has its own depth range of [-2&lt;&lt;30,2&lt;&lt;30&rang; 
if one is necessary. The problem is that the keys is also 
signed, which would mean that priorities 2 and 3 would count as 
negative and therefore be sorted in front of prio 0 and 1, which 
would be bad. To remedy this, I subtract 0x60000000, which shifts the 
range of priority 0 to the most negative range where it should be.
</p>
<p>
The last part of the function updates the OAM shadow to OAM, either 
with or without sorting.

<div class="nh">Sorting disabled objects</div>
<p>
Incidentally, you could easily modify the sort-key creation to account 
for disabled/hidden objects. All you'd have to do is assign the 
highest (signed) value to the sort-key, in this case 0x7FFFFFFF.

<h4>Rest of code</h4>
<p>
The rest of the code is just <code>main()</code> and the 
initializer code. Most of the initializer code is pretty standard 
stuff: loading graphics, register inits and so on. The only 
interesting part is the object initialization, 
which sets the pal-banks to 0x4000 and 0x6000 for the red and cyan 
orbs. And because the sorting uses an index table instead of 
changing the object buffer itself, this is all I'll ever have to 
keep the primary colors correct.

<b>Fig 24.3</b>: Sorting switched off.
</div>

<p>
The main loop checks for state changes, advances and updates the 
sprites and objects and prints the current angular velocity.
</p>
<p>
There are two state switches in <code>g_state</code>, one that 
toggles the sorting procedure (<code>S_SORT</code>, with 
<b>select</b>), and one that sets the rotation to automatic or 
not (<code>S_AUTO</code>, with <b>start</b>). Toggling the 
sorting is interesting because you can see what happens if you 
just set the priorities. This has two effects 
(see fig&nbsp;24.3: first, the 
orb-order in each strand would be fixed and every object would 
partially obscure the one on its left, which is incorrect for
the receding parts of the strands. This is most visible at the 
right-most side, where the strands seem broken. The second 
effect is the object priority/number order bug where the deeper 
object can show through the background that's supposed to be 
occluding it.
</p>
<p>
The start button toggles between automatic and manual rotation. 
During automatic mode you can change &omega; with <b>L</b> and 
<b>R</b>. In manual mode L and R update the phase with the 
current angular speed. By setting the speed really low, you can 
examine what happens in more detail. For example, you can 
clearly see that the objects in the vertical centerline are 
in front of both their left and right neighbors, exactly what 
one would expect. Unless the sorting is off, that is.
</p><br>

<p>
And that concludes the topic of priorities and object sorting. 
Remember that the priorities of objects and backgrounds aren't 
the only thing that determine the rendering order, the obj or bg 
number is also important for each priority level. Once you start 
mixing objects and background priorities, make sure that the 
object numbers follow the same order as their priorities, and that 
often means object sorting.
</p>
<p>
I've discussed a simple and flexible sorting method, but I warn you 
that it does take its time. If it's good enough, by all means use it. 
If it's not, faster methods can certainly be created. Linked lists, 
range checks, handcrafted assembly (see <tt>id_sort_shell2.s</tt> in 
the <tt>prio_demo</tt> directory for example) can all help make it 
faster. but the final implementation will be up to you.
